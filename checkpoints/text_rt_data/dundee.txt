Are tourists enticed by these attractions threatening their very existence? The two young sea-lions took not the slightest interest in our arrival. They were playing on the jetty, rolling over and tumbling into the water together, entirely ignoring the human beings edging awkwardly round them. Our party then had to step gingerly over hundreds of marine iguanas basking on the rocks, strange creatures with richly coloured velvet coats, looking like something between a giant lizard and a miniature dinosaur, and found nowhere else on earth except here in the Galapagos. A little further on were the blue-footed boobies, birds with brilliant china-blue feet, again unique. And then there were the flightless cormorants, birds with vestigial wings who, over the generations, have lost the ability to fly because the nutrients at the shoreline are so rich they have no need to leave. The island of Fernandina lies at the far western edge of the Galapagos archipelago, dominated by a volcano that last erupted only six years ago, and home to some of the most remarkable wildlife in the world. It was late afternoon on one of the last days of the year, and we had come ashore to scramble round the rough dark lava rocks of Punta Espinosa on the island. In the golden afternoon light, with the moon rising above the volcanoes on Isabela Island across the strait, we could be forgiven for thinking that we were guests in paradise. The creatures you see in the Galapagos are remarkable in their rarity. They are even more so for their lack of fear. They don't run away. They carry on basking or playing or mating or incubating their eggs or fighting for territory with blissful disregard for human beings. It is as if you are walking into a David Attenborough programme, and finding that the real thing is even better than you ever imagined. The closeness of the living natural world, in this environment of volcanic rock and sweeping beaches and sparse vegetation, makes the Galapagos experience special. The colours help, too. The intense black of the rock, the startling blue of sea and sky, the crimson of the mating frigate-birds, the yellow of the warblers, the brilliant orange of the American oyster-catchers, the glistening silver of hundreds of dolphins swooping round your ship in the dawn light. We spent eight days in all, aboard a boat called Tropic Sun, visiting all parts of the islands. We lived, ate and slept on the boat and went ashore two or three times a day, to walk the trails, see the wildlife, and snorkel in the sea. The boat was hardly the most luxurious experience we'd ever had, and was certainly not a centre of gastronomic excellence. But that really wasn't the point. It took us to the places we wanted to see; and the expert guide we had, who led us round the trails and explained the flora and fauna to us, was the best we could possibly have wanted. You need not be an inveterate birdwatcher or naturalist to be captivated by what you see. You simply cannot help being taken over by a sense of wonder at this different and special world. Darwin's visit, in 1835, aboard HMS Beagle lasted five times longer. He marvelled at the tortoises and the iguanas, but it was the tiny finches that jolted his imagination most vividly. They are still called Darwin's Finches in his honour. There are 13 different species of the finches across the islands (our group managed to see five or six). The fascination is in the beaks. Each species on each island has, over time, developed a differently shaped beak, adapted to the vegetation and the competition in that particular location. These tiny birds with tiny distinctions helped to produce one of the greatest ever advances in the history of scientific thought. Since Darwin called, these islands on the Equator have struggled to maintain the fragile balance of their ecology. Over the years, the indigenous animal population has been under increasing threat, from wayward fishermen, or from feral dogs, goats and rats escaping from human settlements or boats. Recently the Ecuador authorities started trying to eradicate the invading species, and have now succeeded in freeing some entire islands from non-native creatures. A giant tortoise breeding programme is in place, rearing infants in a protected environment at a time when they are at greatest risk, and then returning them to the wild. And there are strict laws now in place against harming or destroying the wildlife - though only recently a group of 12 slain tortoises was discovered killed apparently for the Japanese aphrodisiac market. The most serious ecological threat, however, is posed by the greatest economic boon the islands have ever had: tourism. Ninety boats, ranging in size from 12 passengers to 100, do the rounds of the islands. And on the whole, the schedules are managed well. The itineraries are staggered, so that at most two or three boats might appear at one location at the same time. When you go ashore you have to be with a guide, you cannot stray from the marked trails, and you cannot touch the wildlife. One of the passengers on our boat was roundly and rightly chastised for stroking a young sea-lion - an action with potentially fatal consequences for the sea-lion because of the risk of rejection by the mother. In a country as poor as Ecuador, the temptation to increase the numbers of tourists is always there. We were told there's been a recent request for permission for a much larger boat to travel round the Galapagos, carrying some 500 passengers. I shudder to think what might happen if such a boat arrived at Punta Espinosa and disgorged everyone on to Fernandina Island at the same time. Not only would the shock of a thousand tramping feet endanger the rock, the sand, and the teeming wildlife that depends on it; but it would seriously degrade the quality of the visitors' own experience. Herein lies one of the oldest dilemmas about the evolution of tourism. We value, and to want to visit, the unique and fragile environments of the world. Yet in visiting we risk destroying the very qualities that render those places so enticing. This is especially true where the rarity of the place is quite so marked as it is in the Galapagos. Responsible tourism lies in absolute respect for the location and its inhabitants. It lies in treading carefully wherever we go. It lies in ensuring that the economic contribution we make by going helps to conserve rather than to destroy. And it lies in developing the international networks protecting endangered species and world heritage so that they can make a difference on the ground. Fortunately, in the Galapagos, Charles Darwin would recognise much of what he saw if he returned today. It is our duty to ensure that he would recognise it again, another two centuries hence. 'For the last three weeks there has been an utterly inexplicable rise in the prison population of about 600 prisoners a week.' The words of Martin Narey, the director-general of the Prison Service, ought to prompt more than the customary political panic. By this morning the prison population, which seemed to have stabilised at around 45,000 in the late 1980s and early 1990s, will have passed the 70,000 mark. Although the causes of the surge of the past three weeks have baffled those who might know, the underlying trend, a rise in the number of prisoners of 5,000 since this time last year, is utterly explicable, and indeed was predicted. Prison policy in the UK has been an uphill slalom for the past half-century. Politicians, under pressure to do something about crime, pass laws and write guidelines requiring more criminals to be imprisoned for more crimes for longer. Every now and then, however, there is a crisis as the walls of our prisons begin to bow under the weight of numbers contained therein. Politicians then scrabble around for 'tough' alternatives to jail, which they try to sell to a sceptical public, educated only in a simple lock-'em-up logic that reached its conclusion in the bone-jarring stupidity of Michael Howard's 'prison works' slogan. The prison-building programme then catches up with the prison population, and we resume the zig-zag which has given us the least successful prison policy in Europe. The election of a Labour government committed to being tough on the causes of crime was a chance to break this self- defeating sequence. Unfortunately, Tony Blair's first Home Secretary, Jack Straw, lacked the courage to seize it. David Blunkett is a more adventurous figure and shows some signs of being willing to challenge the assumptions of the past, but he still poses too often for the unitive gallery. At least he will have no difficulty in rejecting a demand from the Prison Governors' Association to take away from magistrates altogether the power to hand down custodial sentences. But will he use this crisis to ask deeper questions about why so many people are in prison, and whether they should be? One of the causes of the rise in the prison population in the past seven years has been the growth of illegal drug use, with crack cocaine a particular problem. This week's suggestion that shock tactics should be used to discourage young people from trying heroin is off the point. Information is important, but the interplay between the desire to escape reality and addiction is more complex than a simple Pavlovian model. Medicalising addiction rather than keeping it in the criminal underworld offers the best hope both of controlling hard-drug use and of limiting the effect on crime. If people who have problems with illegal drugs, alcohol or mental health were taken out of our prisons, there would be hardly anyone left. When it comes to the wider causes of crime, however, one of the best places to start is prison itself. With 58 per cent of inmates recorded as reoffending within two years of release, prison clearly does not work. A brave Home Secretary would conclude that prison obviously reinforces many of the causes of crime. It breaks up families and usually gives prisoners nothing better to do than plan how not to get caught next time. All parties welcomed the Woolf report of 1991, yet none has acted on it to improve the education service in prison. If schoolchildren can have life coaches, why not prisoners? Instead, education, anger-management courses and anything constructive are often the first things to be cut when governors come under pressure to save money. Our prison system is an affront to a civilised society, as is witnessed by the number of legal actions brought by prisoners under the Human Rights Act. Even if the voters did not care about that, they should care that it is a very expensive way of training criminals for more crime. Many of the alternatives to prison may not result in much better reoffending rates, but at least they are cheaper. Mr Blunkett should make the radically pragmatic case for the humane treatment of the nation's criminals as a first step in tackling the causes of crime. Here's something to chew over when pondering the growing problem of obese children. The fattest child in my daughter's primary school class was also the cleverest. Her mother came from Kuala Lumpur and latched onto me as a fellow Eurasian when we waited to collect our children after school. Far from being worried or embarrassed by Hannah's Humpty Dumpty physique - at seven her daughter weighed close to 10 stone - she was obviously proud of what she called Hannah's 'very good size'. At break, while the others played football, Hannah sat on a bench absorbed in the Reader's Digest or the Ladybird Guide to the Solar System steadily working her way through a family size pack of mini Mars bars. She came to tea once and explained why, although the individual galaxies were constricting, the universe itself was expanding. She wanted to be an astronaut. I had just come back from a press trip to Hawaii where one morning all of us, apart from a Midlands radio presenter called Kenny, had been taken by helicopter to see some spectacular waterfalls. Kenny couldn't come because the tour guide said he was too fat and would upset the balance of the helicopter. I'd told the children about Kenny and hoped they wouldn't bring it up. They didn't because, believe it or not, they really hadn't noticed Hannah was overweight. 'Hannah the clever one,' they'd say, not 'Hannah she's fat.' I wish this story had a happy ending for there's no reason why stories about fat people shouldn't. Take Kenny. From the neck down he looked like Mr Blobby but he had a surprisingly lean, mean profile and a devastatingly sexy voice. Women in the Midlands wrote in every week to tell Kenny how much they fancied him. When we got back from our waterfall trip, we found him on the hotel terrace drinking beer and dealing with his fan mail. Hannah, I'm sure, could have ended up as content as Kenny, but at 12 she was screwed up by the therapist her mother got hold of to help her lose weight. Please note it wasn't Hannah who wanted to look like Kate Moss, it was her mother forcing her. From being a bright, happy, clever fat girl, Hannah became a depressed neurotic anorexic teenager who only read books about fashion and diets. I bumped into her mother the other day outside the Post Office. 'How's Hannah?' I said. She was at a health clinic in Portugal doing alternate sessions of meditation and colonic irrigation, said her mother. Since the obesity report came out, parents have been swamped with advice about how to control their children's diets and lifestyle. The older I get, the less I'm convinced that we poor parents have any control over our children at all. This depressing opinion was confirmed by Sir Richard Doll, the first doctor to discover the link between cancer and smoking. He was on Desert Island Discs, and when Sue Lawley asked plaintively what parents could do to stop their children smoking, Sir Richard said: 'Absolutely nothing.' In fact, he opined, the more parents nagged at children not to smoke, the more likely it was that they would. As long as they stopped in their mid-thirties, they wouldn't die of lung cancer, he thought, and there was a very strong chance they would stop smoking as adults having weighed up all the evidence against it. I'm sure the same argument applies to obesity. Keep nagging at children to stop snacking, switch off the television and take exercise, the more they will guzzle and slump. Waiting outside the fitting rooms of a Kings Road shop the other day, I was surprised and dismayed not by how fat kids are these days but how unhealthily skinny they are, especially teenage girls. The ones trying on crop tops and trousers looked less like nubile young women than scaffolding. If you want to see serious obesity, go to Miami airport. It's more obvious out there because everyone is wearing shorts. The entire airport smells of cinnamon, the preferred topping for all those doughnuts they're selling. You see entire families sitting at doughnut stalls with buckets of doughnuts between their knees. Now that's obesity.
Tony Blair is engaged in low politics on fox-hunting. The timing of this, his third initiative, seems to have been influenced by the need to get Stephen Byers through his trial by ordeal in the House of Commons on Tuesday. Not only did it reward Labour backbenchers for their show of loyalty, but it helped move the media caravan on from the semantics of lying by presenting them with a new - or, rather, renewed - controversy. However, Labour backbenchers are not so stupid that they can be bought off with yet another meaningless vote that allows them to express their opinions and is then forgotten. Equally, public opinion, which on this issue is wrong but unmistakable, would not easily understand another marching of the abolitionist troops up the hill only for them to be marched down again. Most people think that hunting with dogs is cruel, that it should be banned and that the Government should get on with it. The real low politics of Mr Blair's return to this subject, therefore, is that of reaching a compromise with the House of Lords. Whatever the presentational value with his own party of occasional confrontations with the 'forces of conservatism' in red coats and on horseback, the Prime Minister is unlikely to want to provoke another full-dress showdown with the 'countryside' lobby. The last time he picked a fight with them, the Deputy Prime Minister and a protester had to be prised apart in a flower-bed in Rhyl in the middle of a general election campaign. On 18 March, the Commons will undoubtedly vote, overwhelmingly again, for a complete ban on hunting. If left to themselves, the Lords would just as overwhelmingly vote to leave things as they are. Mr Blair may hope that the threat of the Parliament Act - which requires the will of the Commons ultimately to prevail over that of the upper House - will encourage the Lords to opt for the compromise instead. Getting the Lords to decide that the 'Middle Way' compromise scheme is the lesser of two evils depends, however, on the credibility of the threat to use the Parliament Act. The Lords could call Mr Blair's bluff if they judge that he really would not want to have the so-called countryside march on Whitehall again. This is no way to decide an issue of principle. The majority of people in Britain confuse their distaste for a minority pursuit with the instinct that 'there ought to be a law against it'. There should not be, just as there should be no law against the rather more popular sport of angling. The undue attention devoted to one particular means of culling animals owes too much to the perceived class connotations of 'country sports' and sanctimony about humans deriving pleasure from it. What requires legislation is the less visible cruelty towards factory-farmed chickens and pigs, and towards other animals in transit, not to mention cruel and unnecessary experiments on primates. A compromise between a ban on hunting and no ban is dishonest. The idea of licensed or regulated cruelty makes no sense. It would be better if the Prime Minister and all those MPs who vote for a ban simply to earn easy applause from a vocal and passionate minority of their constituents were courageous enough to explain to the voters that, while some activities may offend our sensibilities, they should not all be banned. The Middle Way is a classic Blairite fudge. It is unlikely to satisfy either side - although the anti-hunters are likely to be the more disappointed, because hunting would continue, with only some of its more repellent excesses curtailed. The Prime Minister would earn a great deal more respect if he said what he really thought and explained and defended that, instead of trying to fix his way out of a political problem. Today in the European Parliament's chamber in Brussels, 105 men and women from 28 European nations will gather to begin discussing a constitutional settlement for Europe. Europe has a constitution now, of course, but, in its various official languages, it runs into literally millions of pages of legislation, council decisions and commission directives, known collectively as the 'acquis' - not exactly a household term in Europe's salons and saunas. This tangle of laws and regulations has long cried out to be formulated into a few simple rules, with the paramount aim of bringing Europe closer to its people, as the jargon goes. The question is whether the Constitutional Convention, now assembled under the leadership of the former French president Val‚ry Giscard d'Estaing, is an appropriate vehicle to deliver a new constitutional settlement. Certainly the choice of Mr Giscard to run things doesn't inspire a great deal of confidence. The fact that he is old should be no obstacle, although his slightly sleazy past (remember the Bokassa diamonds scandal?) detracts a little from his dignity. The more serious drawback with Mr Giscard is simply the suspicion that he will guide the convention in a direction that reflects the traditional French approach to governance - not so much libert‚, fraternit‚, egalit‚ as ‚litisme, dirigisme, technocratie. That trinity was, in fact, very much the foundation of the institutions of the original European Community as set out in the Treaty of Rome of 1957. It was the vision of Jean Monnet and Robert Schumann, the French founding fathers of the community, and of the Comit‚ d'Action pour les Etats-Unis d'Europe that they founded. These arrangements worked well for the small community of the Six, but in a union of 15 they are distinctly creaky. All agree that in a union of 25 or 30 - the position we could easily be in before the decade is out - such arrangements would be unsustainable. The danger is that Mr Giscard, a typical product of the French ‚lite, will simply want to give us 'more of the same', but with a much stronger centre. That would mean a stronger Commission and a 'leadership' role for the big five (France, the UK, Germany, Italy and Spain) to cope with the demands of a 30-state union. Indeed, worries about expansion leading to a wider but looser EU underlay the French government's past resistance to welcoming new members from Scandinavia and the east. Still, there are reasons to be optimistic. Mr Giscard will not be able to have things all his own way in a 105-member commission, especially as the British are providing its chief executive in the form of Sir John Kerr, a supermandarin and diplomat. And the Laeken Declaration that set up the convention declared that 'European institutions must be brought closer to citizens. They want them to be less unwieldy and more efficient and open.' That cannot be ignored. By far the best way of ensuring that Europe is brought closer to its people is to provide for a stronger European Parliament. Until that is done, there is very little chance of a truly pan-European party system developing and, with that, a European level of debate. More sessions of the European Council should be open to the cameras and the public. And, most importantly, there should be a much stronger formal commitment to the principle of subsidiarity, with more decision-making devolved to national, regional and local levels. More than ever, in a union of 30 states, Europe should concentrate on performing the tasks - in the economic, environmental and even defence fields - where it can make a difference. Surely Mr Giscard has to understand that. The prospect of meeting an old but long-separated schoolfriend can trigger far more fear than joy. Did the charismatic soul who thrilled your teenage self evolve into a bore, a prig, an oaf? Worse, did they never possess the virtues you innocently pinned to them? What applies to people applies, in spades, to literature. To re-read a favourite author of one's youth is to court incredulity, and even self-disgust. How could I have rated that pretentious garbage/sentimental schlock? Around the age of 15, I adored John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath almost more than any other novel. Soon enough, I learnt this was an inadmissible affection. Too folksy, too naturalistic, stylistically immature, politically na‹ve: the hit squads of academic criticism had dropped down hard on Steinbeck even before his death in 1968. He was born - in Salinas, California - on 27 February 1902, and next week Allen Lane publishes an ample selection of his non-fiction to mark the centenary: Of Men and their Making, edited by Susan Shillinglaw and Jackson J Benson (œ25). Of course, I opened it with trepidation. Would Steinbeck prove as cringingly embarrassing as every other 15-year-old crush? I need not have worried. Of Men and their Making is a constant delight, a generous, open-hearted vaudeville show of a book that switches from elegantly crafted memoirs to frivolous pieces on fishing or Fords, from thrilling reportage to sinewy meditations on politics and culture. Not all of it is perfect, or profound. Steinbeck wrote reams of journalism over three decades, and one leading item on the academic charge-sheet states that he squandered too much talent on ephemera. But, all in all, his praise for Mark Twain's 'incredible ear and eye and sense of form' as a subjective observer goes for Steinbeck, too. Here is the democratic American voice in all its glory: friendly, courageous, compassionate, keen to go everywhere, see everything, and capture it all in pacy, spirited prose that can swing between high ideas and street life without missing a beat. The collection teems with hundreds of images and phrases that kick, and bite, and stay - from the childhood memory of a phonograph that 'leaped from a shelf and destroyed itself' in the California earthquake of 1906 to the vision of Bob Hope in London in 1943, wisecracking to a hospital ward of maimed soldiers and magically drawing 'laughter up out of the black water'. We revisit the beautifully-evoked California towns of Steinbeck's youth; and we follow him into the itinerant workers' camps of the Dust Bowl years, in articles that mount a ringing defence of the dignity of 'economic migrants'. The editors choose some grittily memorable wartime reportage; some charming accounts of postwar Europe; and portraits of his friends, from Woody Guthrie and Robert Capa to Henry Fonda. (Watching John Ford's fine film of The Grapes of Wrath after 20 years, Steinbeck is galvanised when this 'lean, stringy, dark-faced piece of electricity walked out on the screen'). Even the 1966 text of a photo book on America and Americans, written when he had allegedly gone soft, is typically abrasive about his countrymen's taste for narcissism and racism: 'from the first we have treated our minorities abominably, the way the old boys do the new kids in school.' Steinbeck was not always prescient (like many other US liberals, he supported the early stages of the war in Vietnam). Yet these 400 pages rattle by without a snide thought, a cheap shot or a dead sentence from beginning to end. At a time when establishment America takes on the sepulchral tones of Donald Rumsfeld (or the silences of Kenneth Lay), this book could achieve more for the nation's prestige overseas than a hundred extra CIA recruits. In the list of picture captions you never thought you'd see in the pages of a serious newspaper, '160-million-year-old vomit' is right up there with 'Joan Collins and her new husband, also 68'. But '160 million-year-old vomit' was precisely the caption in Tuesday's papers, relating to the thrilling discovery of fossilised dinosaur puke in a clay quarry near Peterborough. Let's leave to the panellists of Have I Got News for You the cheap gibe that the Daily Telegraph - with a substantial number of fossils and dinosaurs among its readers - was stirring nostalgia rather than publishing bona fide news. Instead, let's consider what a fabulous discovery this is, beyond even Steven Spielberg's wildest dreams. Professor Peter Doyle, of the University of Greenwich, believes that the fossils found near Peterborough are partly-digested shellfish regurgitated by ichthyosaurs, marine reptiles. How he reached this conclusion is not the business of this column, thank God (not, of course, that the Almighty has any place in palaeontology). But it is certainly interesting to dwell on the significance of his conclusion. For one thing, it heaps enviable prestige upon Peterborough, which until this week had only its handsome Norman cathedral to boast about. But there aren't too many places in the world able to demonstrate proof that an ichthyosaur once chundered somewhere in the vicinity. Thinking about it, though, it is quite possible that the people of Peterborough would rather not adopt this as a claim to fame, just as the townsfolk of Slough tend not to put it about that John Betjeman once wrote a poem about them. As for the vomiting side of the equation, I don't know if you've noticed, but throwing-up has been looming large in popular culture. Billy Connolly was one of the first to draw attention to it, wondering why drunkards being sick call so despairingly for Ralph and Huey. And although vomiting was one of the last human bodily functions to get a regular airing on television, rare is the drama now that does not feature at least one person spewing into a toilet. Certainly, no self-respecting soap lets New Year's Eve go without a character chucking up after too much alcohol; we have even had animated vomit, on The Simpsons. I mention this because, until now, palaeontology has rubbed shoulders with popular culture only in the BBC series Walking With Dinosaurs - which, as brilliant as it was, tended to drag once you'd marvelled at the special effects for long enough - and in the irritating form of Ross in the sitcom Friends. But Professor Doyle's discovery changes everything. I have a six-year-old son who knows the difference between a protoceratops and a diplodocus like he knows the difference between baked beans and strawberry jam. However, he has been to the Natural History Museum dozens of times and it no longer lights his fire. When I told him about the ichthyosaur pebble-dashing parts of Cambridgeshire with shellfish, however, he was all ears. He was plainly enthralled by the idea that anything Jurassic might behave in the same way as he did the other night after a tummy bug brought up his spaghetti bolognese. Might behave, better still, like Bart Simpson. What is needed now is for an enterprising children's telly producer, perhaps the person behind that sickeningly cute dinosaur Barney, to make a show about twin ichthyosaurs called Ralph and Huey. And the thought also occurs that some graduate student might want to consider a thesis on the enthralling history of vomit. I was once shown round a vomitorium, where middle-class Romans went to bring back their dinners. It was fascinating. But I can't for the life of me remember where it was. For Peterborough's sake, not there, I hope.
The decision of the Human Fertility and Embryology Authority (HFEA) to allow a couple to select genetically their next baby was bound to raise concerns that advances in biotechnology are racing ahead of our ability to control the consequences. The couple at the centre of this case have a son who suffers from a potentially fatal disorder and whose best hope is a marrow transplant from a sibling, so the stakes of this decision are particularly high. The HFEA's critics believe that it sanctions 'designer babies' and does not show respect for the sanctity of individual life. Certainly, the authority's backing for Shahana and Raj Hashmi's plea for genetic screening raises fundamental questions about producing one human being to cure another's disease. But the parents' view is simple and compelling. The IVF treatment is available to help produce a baby whose tissue will match his or her elder brother's bone marrow. They require, as Mrs Hashmi puts it, 'a helping hand' from the HFEA. Screening for genetic disorders has been permissible for some time. Those who oppose the treatment on grounds that it echoes destructive eugenics programmes have misplaced their concern. The use of such techniques to weed out genes that might result in a disability does not suggest that disabled people are 'defective'. It merely uses progress to prevent a malfunction of nature. They would not reject medical intervention to put right other things that go wrong with the body. Yet they ask that mankind pass up the chance to use scientific advances in biotechnology to prevent unnecessary suffering. The inconsistency is striking and would be cruel if it were allowed to impede a beneficial solution. The HFEA already backed tissue-type screening in principle in December. This latest move is a logical advance. We can welcome that and still accept the need to maintain the distinction between these and more frivolous or dubious reasons why parents might want to opt for genetic pre-selection. That is why it is also right that the HFEA continues to reject genetic pre-selection if it helps parents choose gender, let alone more superficial preferences for a certain appearance. Grounds of pure preference are not enough to make parental choice paramount and the authority should resist pressure to give in on this point. The Hashmis' aim is very different. They are concerned with saving a life, as well as creating one. They and their doctors may reject other embryos as imperfect matches, but they are not selecting their baby as if it were a designer coat or handbag. This is a clear case of maximising benefits and minimising harm. The parents want another child, and their existing son will be the beneficiary. Critics of such technology warn that the child is to be used as a means rather than an end in itself. Instead of being valued for his or her own sake, they say, the next Hashmi baby's raison d'ˆtre will be his life-saving qualities. Yet in wanting their child to serve a certain purpose, this couple is merely following in the footsteps of countless couples before them: couples who have wanted a child to boost their own relationship, or provide their first-born with a sibling. The Hashmis' decision is like that of any other couple who want the best for their child. Shahana and Raj Hashmi will undoubtedly love their next baby as much as their first. As David Beckham discovered to his cost, the manager of Manchester United likes to have the last word. Which is why he's signed up for another 3 years and œ11m. One of the defining moments of Sir Alex Ferguson's glorious but often contentious career as manager of Manchester United came in February 2000 when David Beckham, his star player, failed to report for training. Beckham said his baby son was ill, and that he needed to be at home with him. Fair enough. But when Ferguson discovered that Beckham's wife Victoria was out shopping at the time, he hit the roof. According to someone who knows him well, the publicity machine that surrounds the Beckhams has always been intensely irritating to him. Now, by his lights, Beckham was letting the side down, and in Ferguson's book there is no greater sin. For the next match Beckham was kicked out of the team. He wasn't even a substitute. It seemed unthinkable to drop Beckham - to put a personal squabble, as some saw it, before the interests of the team. But Ferguson had done it. What the incident really betrayed was a clash of cultures - a 21st-century, new-man touchy-feeliness on the one hand, and on the other, the hard, man's world that shaped Ferguson, growing up among the Scottish working class in the 1950s. It certainly wasn't one in which wives have the definitive say in their husband's lives, which is ironic in the light of what lay behind last week's news that, far from retiring at the end of this season, as had previously been announced, Ferguson will remain at Old Trafford for another three years. Though no great lover of the game, Ferguson's wife Cathy knew what it meant to him, and could still mean, and she perhaps didn't relish the prospect of having this great, brooding figure about the house with no outlet for his footballing energies. No matter that he has achieved everything at United - the European Cup, seven Premier League titles, four FA Cups and one League Cup - or that he turned 60 at the end of 2001. Cathy Ferguson could see that there was plenty left in him, and her intervention was crucial. Why not carry on? 'As Cathy says, 'retire when you feel tired',' Ferguson said last week. 'And I feel strong, young, and fit.' Family has always been important to Ferguson, and so, by extension, have the wider roots of his upbringing. In his case, that was Govan, the Clydeside district on the south-western edge of Glasgow, where his father, Alex snr, was one of 100,000 or so men who built ships. The sense of community in which Ferguson grew up was palpable, and as a young toolmaker in a Glasgow factory, he was soon involved in the union. Full-time professional football did not come until he was 22, when he joined Dunfermline. Spells at three other clubs followed. He ran a pub in Glasgow before taking up his first managerial post, at St Mirren. But it was as the manager of Aberdeen, from 1978 to 1986, that Ferguson made his mark, breaking the hold over Scottish football enjoyed by Rangers and Celtic, before moving to Manchester. United was a club on which the past bore down. With both the Munich air disaster of 1958 and the triumphs of the late 1960s, it had a unique legacy that it was struggling to live up to. Since the retirement, in 1971, of the great Sir Matt Busby, a succession of managers had come and gone with little to show. Would Ferguson do any better? In the early years, it was touch and go whether he would survive. But he bought some time by winning the FA Cup in 1990, and the elusive championship, the club's first for 26 years, finally arrived in 1993, in the inaugural Premier League season. Since then, United have been almost unstoppable, as both a footballing and a commercial force. Ferguson's achievement has been to withstand the pressure that goes with running the world's biggest club, and at the same time maintain the attacking tradition of the United sides of old. Even United's detractors - the club is fiercely resented for its stranglehold on the English game - have to admit that, under Ferguson, domestic football has been raised to breathtaking new levels. If such erudite Continentals as the England manager, Sven Goran Eriksson, and ArsŠne Wenger of Arsenal seem to represent a new studiousness in football, then Ferguson might be seen as a throwback to an age when the sort of men to whom he is heir - tough fellow-Scots such as Bill Shankly and Jock Stein - seethed with a passion for the game, and exuded a sometimes terrifying authority. But you don't get to be the towering figure that Ferguson has become without the shrewdness, attention to detail and profound understanding of players' personalities which no powers of intimidation can make up for. It's just that, unlike Eriksson and Wenger, Ferguson has been known to go into rages in which tables have been kicked and teacups thrown. 'There's a difference between old-style and old-fashioned,' says Alastair Campbell, the Downing Street press chief who has welcomed Ferguson as a staunch Labour supporter. 'Yes, he's old- style in that he's disciplined and he leads from the top. But what people perhaps don't understand about Alex is that he has an incredibly acute intelligence. He was one of the first to appreciate the importance of diet and training regimes for players. At the same time he understands that United is a huge business. I'd say all that puts him in the 'new manager' mould.' Few managers form bonds with players as Ferguson does. He has regarded the Welsh winger Ryan Giggs almost as a son ever since he broke into the team as a gifted 17-year-old. In Roy Keane, United's irresistible Irish midfielder, Ferguson sees many of his own formidable qualities. And with Eric Cantona, Peter Schmeichel and now the brilliant Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, Ferguson has found his faith in individual genius, with all its attendant pitfalls, spectacularly rewarded. 'Ferguson's probably the last manager who can use fear as a weapon to deal with players,' says the sportswriter Ken Jones. 'That's very difficult today because the players have so much money that they can just turn round and tell you where to go.' When loyalty to players is not returned, Ferguson does not easily forgive. Likewise when he feels press criticism is unjustified. This season has seen a low point in his often turbulent relationship with reporters, with Ferguson cancelling press conferences and haranguing people when he does agree to turn up. One of Ferguson's three sons, Jason, is also his agent, and the questions raised about this arrangement have seriously rankled with him. Does Ferguson bear grudges? 'It's more that he always has to have the last word,' says someone close to him. Of course he has mellowed over the years. As the owner of some top-class horses, he derives huge pleasure from racing, often turning up on the gallops early in the morning after a match the night before. There was a time when he felt undervalued at United. What mattered to him about the big pay increase he secured a few years ago was not what it could buy him but what it said about his worth. At œ11m over three years, Ferguson's new contract makes him comfortably Britain's highest paid manager. By the crazy standards of the footballing economy, it is money well spent. It is just a week since The Independent on Sunday launched its asthma campaign, and already ministers have begun to take action. Shrugging off their officials' instinct to try to kick the issue into the long grass, both Michael Meacher, the Environment minister, and Yvette Cooper, the public health minister, have immediately appreciated its importance. Both have referred the scientific studies, revealed in this newspaper, that indicate that traffic fumes can cause asthma, to the official Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollution. Tomorrow Mr Meacher will press his European ministerial colleagues to impose tougher, continent-wide controls on ozone, one of the main pollutants involved. And Ms Cooper is to send new guidance to doctors on tackling the growing epidemic of the disease in children. This is good as far as it goes, and the ministers - two of the best in a not overtalented Government - are to be commended for thinking out of the bureaucratic box. But it is only a small start, and will take time to make a difference. The pollution committee does not meet until June. The new health guidelines will take two years to produce. And Brussels notoriously moves at the pace of the snails so delectably served up in the city's restaurants. The urgency of the crisis blighting the lives of one in every seven British children - and their families - requires a much faster response. It also demands a more far-reaching one. Our report today that two-thirds of British schools fail to help their asthmatic pupils, and that hundreds of thousands of sufferers are not properly informed about their condition, show how shamefully the Departments of Health and Education have neglected the epidemic. Meanwhile the Department of Transport - at Mr Blair's specific backseat instruction - is driving policy in the wrong direction, towards more roads, more cars, more pollution and more asthma. The Prime Minister and the Cabinet ministers in charge of the relevant departments must take on the issue themselves, and institute wholesale changes in policy - or take the blame for continuing child illness and death. The difference between dial-up internet access and a high-speed service that is permanently on is akin to that between a horse-drawn cart and a car, which is why there is usually no going back for people who have graduated from one to the other. So it would be churlish not to applaud the sharp price reduction announced yesterday by BT for its broadband service. Assuming that the internet service providers pass on most of the cut, an average monthly subscription should come down to around œ25 from the œ40 or so it currently costs. This is by any measure a swingeing cut, and makes broadband service in Britain as reasonably priced, if not cheaper, than its equivalent elsewhere in the world. Whether it will be enough to persuade Britons to sign up for the broadband 'revolution' with as much alacrity as Americans or our fellow- Europeans, however, is another matter. Germany already has 2 million subscribers, Britain fewer than 150,000. The wonders of broadband are not at issue. The technology allows the same line to be used for Internet access and telephone calls without either capability blocking the other. It enables audio and video files to be transferred almost instantaneously. Whole films can be delivered in minutes. So why has Britain been so comparatively slow to adopt the new technology? The widely-accepted thesis is that high prices have are the main deterrent. Certainly, œ40 a month is steep, and those cable companies that supply high-speed internet access have already attracted more subscribers than BT, with monthly payments set at œ25. But that is still double the price of many dial-up subscriptions. And for home, rather than professional use, dial-up access is adequate. The price cuts announced by BT mean that the theory of price as the chief obstacle to wider take-up will now be tested. In fact, consumer resistance may lie elsewhere. Even if the price of fast internet access is going down, the price of computers remains static. And, as with mobile phones, there may be a limit to the range of services that people need or want from computers. If they are to conquer the mass market, BT and the internet service providers must work harder to convince people that their most hi-tech services are not only competitively priced, but relevant to their lives.
Decisions on the next phase of the unwisely named war against terrorism are creeping closer, and most of the signs are that George Bush will get them wrong. After he used his State of the Union address to identify the equally unwisely named axis of evil, the pressing question is: what is to be done about Iraq? That something ought to be done about Iraq should not be in doubt. The question is whether the US is going to act against its enemies in a way that creates even more enemies. The next question is whether Britain is going to support whatever President Bush does regardless. Saddam Hussein is still a threat to his neighbours and - potentially - to the US and its allies. Even if the direct risk to the West from his proven wish to acquire weapons of mass destruction is small, the international community has a responsibility to act. As Mr Blair accepted yesterday, there is not any evidence linking Iraq with the terrorist attacks of 11 September. The country must be treated as a problem in its own right, and the issues remain much the same as they were before September last year. The main one is that of sanctions. To his credit, Mr Blair seems to realise that the present sanctions regime plays into Saddam's hands, allowing him to present the Iraqi people as victims of brutal US imperialism. The British attempt at the United Nations last year to lift sanctions on food and most trade foundered on objections by the Russians to the definition of dual-use technology. But it is right to pursue a collective approach, through the UN where possible. The legitimacy of the aerial harassment of Iraq over the past few years has been weakened by the fact that it has been a purely US-British operation. The next phase of the campaign against various forms of international terrorism ought to be conducted through diplomacy, renewing the global coalition - about which Mr Bush seems to have forgotten already - and working for treaties to restrain the proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. Instead, the President seems determined to pursue the short- sighted and negative policy of asserting US might, which will provoke resentment and breed more terrorism. Mr Blair should not be seduced by the collaborationist argument that he will have greater influence over US policy if he expresses doubts in private. He should say, loud and clear, that US policy is in danger of becoming counterproductive. Trouble at bank. An abandoned flip chart in the foyer of a Manchester branch of the Halifax reveals an innovative policy unusual even in the creative world of finance: they don't want customers. Specifically, they don't want new businesses, businesses that deal in coinage: taxi-drivers, window-cleaners, market-traders and shopkeepers. Napoleon would surely have approved. The company might protest that this disinclination is limited to a number of branches, but we doubt it will wash. No business trades on image like a bank, and the Bank That Likes To Say No is splendidly irresistible. Nevertheless, there may well be those who would prefer to bank with a company that refused its facilities to, say, spin doctors, prevaricating politicians, most Antipodean athletes (particularly New Zealand cricketers), anyone associated with the Department of Transport, interior designers on TV, Mike Tyson or Lady Victoria Hervey. We, for our part, however, would like to stress and emphasise our intense delight in having you as a customer and look forward to renewing our most rewarding association tomorrow and for many years to come. Thank you. Taxi! The British have never been especially good at providing for their old age, and the current mayhem in the pensions industry can only serve to make matters worse. For much of the second half of the last century this congenital failure to plan ahead didn't matter so much because of two saving graces, now disappearing fast. The first was the state pension; never generous, often inadequate but never means-tested and always available to all. The second was the employer-funded final salary scheme for staff. Most workers may not have even noticed that they were members of such schemes - to which they often made no contribution of their own - until that happy moment when they collected their gold watch and discovered that they would be on a guaranteed income of, say, two-thirds of their final salary for the rest of their days, irrespective of the vagaries of the stock market. Now these two pillars are crumbling. The worth of the state pension was eroded after the Thatcher government broke the link with average earnings. The abolition of Serps (state earnings-related pension scheme) shortly after also weakened the state's provision. Since Labour came to power in 1997 we have seen a move towards means-testing and the prospect of the basic pension withering on the vine. More seriously, however, we now see the move from final salary schemes turn into a stampede. The pensions watchdog Opra says 58,000 company schemes have been wound up and 30,000 of the remaining 110,000 at risk. Prominent names such as Abbey National, Ernst & Young, Marks & Spencer, BT and J Sainsbury have declared their schemes closed to newcomers. The supermarket group Iceland is even disbanding its scheme for current members, an extraordinary and morally questionable move. This abandonment of final salary schemes is often said by employers to be because of changes in accounting rules (a red herring); because the schemes are getting expensive (true, but probably not unmanageably so), and because of the Chancellor, Gordon Brown's 'stealth tax' on pension funds. On this last point, at least, the companies are right. Mr Brown took œ5bn a year out of the pensions system in the hope no one would notice - a typically Brownian attempt to pretend that public services can be paid for without pain. Well, we now know who will pay for Mr Brown's tax; the young, the pensioners of tomorrow, few of them rich. So without the state or our employers to look after us, what are we to do? The answer to that was provided as long ago as 1988 when the then Chancellor, Nigel Lawson, introduced personal pensions. They were meant to be a portable answer to the one big drawback with final salary schemes - that few of us remained with one employer for our working lives. But the record has not been happy. High charges, misleading claims and spectacular mis-selling have brought the industry into disrepute. The Government's 'stakeholder' scheme was an attempt to remedy these problems and to encourage the lower paid to take out pensions, but it too has met with a lukewarm response. The outlook, then, is bleak. We are just such very poor savers, now with new excuses about the untrustworthy nature of the financial services industry. The answer would seem to lie in the Government providing a much more ambitious version of the stakeholder framework that would make private pensions a safer investment, possibly linked to an element of compulsion. And we need to recognise that there will always be those who will never earn enough to secure an adequate income through a private scheme. For their sakes, the state pension cannot be allowed to wither away. It seems that Norman Mailer has been uncharacteristically quiet about an event that occurred while he was in England on a chat tour. Those interviewing the great man about the new mood of Americans were told that 'we need our manhood reaffirmed every six seconds', and this typically Maileresque soundbite has a curious resonance in the case of Jack Henry Abbott, a convicted murderer, who on 10 February, hung himself in his cell in a Utah penitentiary. Abbott, it might just be remembered, was briefly famous in 1981 when he was the hero, then the villain, of a dramatic tale of the literary life. A couple of years previously, after hearing that Norman Mailer was working on a novel based on the life of the executed murderer Gary Gilmore, Abbott had written a series of letters from Marion Federal Prison, Illinois, about his own miserable life. From the age of 13 onwards, he had spent all his life, apart from a year on the run in 1971, in an institution. Behind bars, he had descended into criminality and was currently serving a sentence for the fatal stabbing of a fellow-inmate. The story that he told, of childhood cruelty and neglect, of woeful judicial prejudice, of survival through violence in the unseen hell of the American penal system, was probably not that unusual. The way that he wrote about it, on the other hand, was. 'This guy isn't a murderer, he's an artist,' Mailer proclaimed, a trifle rashly under the circumstances. He collected the letters, found a publisher for them and wrote an introduction for the book, which was entitled In the Belly of the Beast. During the fuss surrounding publication, he and other writers and actors began to campaign for Abbott's release on parole. The book came out in 1981 and, in the same year, so did its author. Briefly, Abbott became a semi-celebrity in the literary scene. His work was serialised in The New York Review of Books. His ferocious, uncompromising prose was acclaimed. The fact that he was walking free, attending book launches and being interviewed on Good Morning America was seen as triumph of writerly solidarity, a victory for literature over life. Foreign rights in the book were sold worldwide, including to Britain where I, an editor at the time, was the proud publisher. Then, six weeks after Abbott's release, something unfortunate happened. While eating out at a Manhattan restaurant, the newly famous author became involved in an altercation with Richard Adan, a young waiter - an altercation that ended with Adan being stabbed to death. The literary bandwagon came to a juddering halt. Writers get excited when their quiet existence is enlivened by real events, but that was too real. Mailer, Susan Sarandon and a few others attended Abbott's trial but, where there had been enthusiasm, there was now embarrassment. Those of us who had published the book found ourselves quietly burying it. After his excursion into the world of letters, Jack Henry Abbott resumed a life of obscurity. The incident became accepted as a perfect little parable of liberal naivety, illustrating the dangers incurred by intellectuals who meddled in matters beyond their experience. Opinions of Abbott's talent were quietly revised, with commentators inevitably quoting Humbert Humbert's line from Lolita: 'You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style.' But perhaps, now that Abbott is dead, it will be seen that there was more to his story than the gullibility of literary types, that its real tragedy lies deep within American society. Evil is the hot, easy subject over there at the moment. Anyone who wants to look beyond the labels and the name-calling could do worse than to read the letters, sent from the belly of the beast, by Abbott. I have, so far as I recall, kept nude photographs of only one author. It happened during the 1990s when someone called Elizabeth Wurtzel was in England promoting her first book, Prozac Nation. While being interviewed for a men's lifestyle magazine, Wurtzel decided to be more self-revealing than is traditional on these occasions. When the photographer turned up, she stripped off for a series of unscheduled candid shots. I found the results rather more interesting than most author profiles, and for several weeks kept them among my papers for occasional reference. This confession, mildly embarrassing as it may be, is not in the same league as the kind of revelation on which Elizabeth (somehow I feel we are on first-name terms) has built her career. In Prozac Nation, she recounted self-destructive adventures with cocaine, men and therapy during her teens and twenties which had led to an addiction to Prozac. The book was written in over-heated but workmanlike prose and, had she been a bloke, or plain, or middle-aged, it would hardly have been publishable. But Elizabeth was a babe. She was prepared to dish intimate details about herself for journalists, give photographers a few literary skin shots. The book became a bestseller and its author was described as 'the voice of generation.' The ploy worked so well that Elizabeth appeared, cute as ever, on the cover of her next book Bitch: In Praise of Difficult Women. She was topless, of course, but, as a small concession to seriousness, her nipples had been airbrushed out - 'Elizabeth doesn't have any nipples,' her publisher told a reporter when the publicity wagon began to roll again. The content of Bitch was consistent with its presentation. 'Feminist writing has become dry. I want to make it wet again,' Elizabeth announced. After drugs and sex, where does a modern author go? Back to more drugs and sex, of course. This week, a new work from Elizabeth Wurtzel is in the bookshops, recounting her latest addiction, this time to Ritalin, the drug given to hyperactive children. The thought, heartless but irresistible, occurs that professionally this was a neat career move, conforming perfectly to what a publisher wants from an author - the same formula as before, but slightly different. What is interesting about Elizabeth's progress is precisely that her version of emotional porn, the hysterical yet glamorising exploitation of one's own darker secrets, is so sensationally successful. To judge by a lengthy newspaper extract, the new book More, Now, Again is no better written than a promising adolescent's diary, yet its author has been reviewed in Time magazine and interviewed on CNN, while her book has been serialised in an allegedly serious British broadsheet. A brief visit to one of the numerous websites devoted to her life and works reveals where her appeal lies. A fan, Heather, writes that 'each large paragraph I devour gets me one leap closer to being me.' Another message, headed 'A cry for help', is from Jeanette: - i don't know why i cry, can't sleep or concentrate but i'm getting tired. Slowly i'm dying but i'm still trying at 14 to find happiness.' This, surely, is a profitable new publishing genre in the making. If Heather and Jeanette are pretty and ambitious, they too might one day turn their intimate secrets into literary gold. If, as seems more likely, they are neither of these things, they will at least have the dubious reassurance that addiction is sexy, that confession, pushed far enough, could make you the voice of a generation. Meanwhile, my former pin-up is offering her views on virtually anything. In Manhattan during the attack on the World Trade Centre, she later revealed that she felt not the slightest emotional reaction. 'I thought, 'This is a really strange arts project.'' Those following her career may form the same conclusion.
Barrister, war hero, politician. Officially: murdered by Irish National Liberation Army, 30 March 1979. Unofficially: a spy who knew too much? Unanswered questions: was he involved in dirty tricks and extreme right-wing conspiracies? Why did he have to die? And is the story about to be revealed? As far away as Trafalgar Square office-workers felt the shudder. 'What was that?' was the question repeated across central London. Up on the fifth floor of the Ministry of Defence, halfway down Whitehall, someone instantly articulated the answer. 'It's a bomb,' the secretaries were told in quiet, chill tones. It was 30 March 1979, and the dull boom was the sound of what was perhaps the most audacious attack ever mounted on the heart of the British political establishment in modern times. The bomb, planted by an IRA splinter group, had exploded in the underground car park inside the House of Commons. A mercury tilt-switch had been activated in the car of the Tory politician Airey Neave as he drove up the exit ramp. Why Neave? He appeared to be a figure of small consequence. He had last had a post in government in 1959, when he was a junior minister in the transport department. In his current position, as opposition spokesmen on Northern Ireland, he might have seemed no more a target than the score of other British politicians who had held such a post in recent times. In fact, the life that was brought to an end so violently that day was one of the most enigmatic in modern politics. For Airey Neave existed in a shadowy world that shifted constantly between the glare of public life and the furtive secrecy of the British intelligence services. He was a man, indeed, who might be said to have not just a double life, but a triple one. Next month, a new biography of the murdered man, Public Servant, Secret Agent, by the political journalist Paul Routledge, is published. It describes Neave as 'the ghost in the establishment, faceless and featureless, quietly and decisively fixing the course of events'. But will it unravel the real mystery at the heart of the man? Airey Neave was first thrust into the public eye during the Second World War, when, in 1942, he became the first British soldier to escape from the German prisoner-of-war camp in the infamous Colditz Castle, which Nazi propaganda had proclaimed to be 'escape-proof'. It was a schoolboy tale of derring-do in which the Eton and Oxford-educated officer - who had already been mentioned in dispatches and awarded the Military Cross for bravery on the battle-field - teamed up with a Dutch officer to stage a daring escape. Dressed in clothes painted to look like German officers' uniforms, with cardboard badges, they wandered into the castle guardroom and then, with the Dutch officer chatting in fluent German, sauntered past the guards whom they ordered to stand to attention, and out of the gate to freedom. From there they made their way through neutral Switzerland and thence through Vichy France to Spain, Gibraltar and safety, in a feat that played directly to the cherished wartime stereotype of jaunty British pluck. After the war, newly-qualified as a barrister, Neave was assigned to the British War Crimes Team at Nuremberg, where he served the indictments on Goering and the other major Nazi war criminals. Thereafter he moved into politics, and by 1953 had become Conservative MP for the staunch Home Counties seat of Abingdon. War-hero, lawyer, politician: Lt-Col Airey Neave was, by the age of 36, already a man of many parts. Yet that was not all. On his return to Britain after escaping from Colditz he was, on the strength of his experience, recruited by military intelligence to a division of MI6 known as MI9, which advised on escape and insurrection in occupied Europe until the end of the war. Neave took part in clandestine operations behind enemy lines, helping other PoWs to escape. So outraged was Hitler by his activities that Neave's London flat was put on Hitler's target list. Officially, he remained in intelligence until 1951. Unofficially, he never left, continuing to be involved in MI6, as was his wife Diana through her links with the ‚migr‚ Polish community. (Ironically, the couple did not, at the time of their marriage, know about the other's secret life. They found out by chance. 'One night, I lost one of my agents,' Diana revealed many years later, 'and he was one of Airey's, too, so it all came out over dinner.') Neave was never to lose his taste for covert manoeuvring, which proved a more-than-useful asset in the world of politics. In the 1950s, he had a solid but unremarkable career as a junior minister in the colonial and aviation ministries before falling from favour. He had stood down from his job because of illness, but when he returned in good health and asked for a new job, the then chief whip, Edward Heath, told the right-winger: 'You're finished.' For 16 years, Neave nursed his bitterness; and when, in 1975, a challenge was raised to Heath as leader of the Conservative Party, Neave became campaign manager for the rightist contender, Margaret Thatcher. In a tactical masterstroke, Neave encouraged many backbenchers to think that Thatcher stood little chance of victory. He hinted that MPs who were not themselves on the right of the party, but still felt it was time for Heath to go, should vote Thatcher in the first ballot, thus forcing Heath's resignation and allowing other more likely candidates - such as Willie Whitelaw - to enter the race. Yet, in the event, Thatcher performed so well in the first ballot that she beat Heath, her candidacy gaining so much momentum that none of her rivals could catch her. She won and Neave became the leader of her private office, where his influence - and, according to the diaries of the former Tory minister Alan Clark, his subtlety and insight - were such that Mrs Thatcher said that she had been left feeling 'like a puppet whose strings have been cut'. But Neave's manipulations were not restricted to the political arena. Though the Iron Lady, when she became Leader of the Opposition, offered him the chance to shadow any Cabinet post he wanted - and take on the same job when the Tories came to power - he chose to forgo the great offices of state and asked for Northern Ireland. This meant that, in an era when Ireland was replacing the Cold War as the chief preoccupation of military intelligence, the security services had one of their men in a pivotal role at a crucial moment in the history of the province. Quite what Neave's role in the secret service was in the years that followed has never become clear. Critics of British policy in Ulster maintained that British intelligence became involved in treasonable policies. In 1987, the Labour MP Ken Livingstone used the cover of parliamentary privilege to suggest in the House of Commons that Airey Neave was a co- conspirator with MI5 and MI6 in disinformation activities involving the controversial whistle-blowing spies Colin Wallace and Peter Wright. He also alleged that, a week before his murder, Neave sought to recruit a former MI6 officer to set up a small group to involve itself in the internal struggles of the Labour Party. Livingstone's efforts earned him a deluge of condemnation from the British establishment, but there were straws in the wind that induced several security experts to wonder whether something untoward had indeed occurred. These were not the wildest allegations. There were improbable tales about how Neave, and others, had a decade earlier planned to set up an 'army of resistance' to the Labour government of the Wilson era to 'forestall a Communist take-over' and talked of assassinating Tony Benn should he become prime minister. Yet such was the febrile atmosphere of that Cold War epoch that some sceptics gave credibility to the possibility. This was, it must be remembered, the time, about 1970, when Auberon Waugh - fed by various sources, including his MI6 agent uncle Auberon Herbert - produced a series of clearly defamatory articles in Private Eye openly alleging that the former prime minister Harold Wilson was a KGB agent. Even as late as 1975, when Mrs Thatcher became leader of the Conservative Party, groups of senior Tories were secretly gathering to hear spy-writers such as Chapman Pincher address them on the 'grave dangers facing Britain from the left'. It was in response to such beliefs, according to claims by the anti-fascist magazine Searchlight, that plans for secret armed cells to resist a more left-wing Labour government were drawn up by a group that included George Kennedy Young - the ex-deputy director of the British intelligence service MI6 and a notorious racist and anti-Semite - and Airey Neave. The claim gained unexpected credence when, despite official MoD denials, two former British Army generals - Sir Anthony Farrar-Hockley, the former Nato commander of Allied Forces Northern Europe, and General Sir Walter Walker, another former head of Nato's forces - confirmed that a secret armed network of selected civilians was set up in Britain after the war and was secretly modernised in the Thatcher years and maintained into the 1980s. Moreover, Searchlight alleged, Neave and Young were key figures in an extreme- right group called Tory Action, which was at the centre of a smear campaign, involving the secret services, aimed at discrediting the Labour government in Britain in 1975. Yet, whatever fire burned behind the smoke of such talk, what was beyond dispute was that the paramilitaries of the IRA - and its splinter group the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), which planted the fateful bomb under Airey Neave's car - saw in Margaret Thatcher's ‚minence grise an opponent of such significance that he had to be taken out. The INLA, made up of members of the Official IRA who defected after its 1972 cease-fire and Provos who resented their leaders' cessation of violence in 1975, justified Neave's assassination because they said he engaged in 'rabid militarist calls for more repression against the Irish people'. But it was more than rhetoric they feared. They saw in Airey Neave the architect of a new hardline British policy on Northern Ireland which would place an increased emphasis on a militarist approach to the political problem. In the months after his death that hardening came about, though many commentators would see it not as a preordained strategy but a response to increased republican terror. Not long after Neave's assassination, the Queen's uncle, Lord Mountbatten of Burma, was killed when a terrorist bomb blasted apart his fishing boat and, on the same day, 18 soldiers died in a Provo bomb-blast at Warrenpoint in the worst single-day Ulster death toll for a decade. Perhaps it was small wonder that, when republican prisoners in the Maze prison demanding Special Category Status went on hunger strike, Margaret Thatcher decided to let them die. In all this, was Airey Neave the cause or just the casualty? Her mentor's death may have strengthened the resolve of Margaret Thatcher not to make any concessions to the IRA, but it seems clear that in 1979 the new Tory government was firmly set in a thought-through policy on how to deal with militant republicanism. The evidence for this is all there in the earlier statements of Airey Neave himself, most pointedly in his call two years earlier for Sinn Fein to be proscribed as a political party. By this Neave disdainfully sought to undermine the republican movement's dual strategy of engagement in the democratic process, backed up by acts of violence. Deprived of the ballot the IRA would have nowhere left to go but back to the bullet, leaving the British authorities with a much stronger tactical argument against the paramilitaries. 'There is no such thing as political murder, political bombing or political violence,' as Mrs Thatcher was later to put it, articulating the philosophy of Airey Neave. 'There is only criminal murder, criminal bombing and criminal violence. We will not compromise on this.' Was there a similar resolution about Airey Neave's contempt for those in the Labour Party whom Tory paranoia in the Seventies deemed to be about to paint England's green and pleasant land a shade of Soviet red? It may now have seeped from the common political memory, but there was in those days talk of private armies being formed as a deterrent to any potential political strike. It was not long after Edward Heath's Conservative government fell in the aftermath of its 'three day week' confrontation with the miners during their 1974 strike. Field Marshall Lord Carver, a former head of the British Armed Forces, later revealed that 'fairly senior' officers at the Army's headquarters had discussed military intervention during the miners' strike in 1974. And when the Labour Party under Harold Wilson was returned to power that year, if alarm bells did not ring loudly behind the closed doors of the intelligence agencies, they certainly did in the political circles in which Neave moved. One of his contacts, General Sir Walter Walker - a man who opined: 'There was a communist cell right there in the middle of Downing Street' - formed a group called Civil Assistance, which later transformed itself into a self-proclaimed private army that called itself Unison and that claimed to have the support of senior serving and retired British forces chiefs. Another, the former SAS leader David Stirling, set up an organisation called Greater Britain 1975 (GB75), whose members included a Jersey-based arms dealer. Stirling, who was described by his biographer as 'well to the right of the Conservative Party', considered the left wing of the Labour Party as 'a cancer'. His fear, summed up in one of his papers for GB75, was expressed thus: 'Why are so many of us blind to an already far advanced conspiracy by the broad Left to topple our democracy? It is now the broad Left which harbours the 'baddies' and which is devoted to creating a privileged class of rulers hell bent on demolishing our individual rights and on creating a totally socialistic and therefore totalitarian state. The near take-over of the Labour Party by its parliamentary left-wing activists in alliance with the trade union extremists poses the most menacing crisis our country has ever faced - more dangerous by far than the worst period of the last World War. This crisis cannot possibly be resolved within parliament alone.' It all sounds so preposterous now. But, at the time, men like Airey Neave - war hero, barrister, politician and secret agent - seemed to believe it. Just how far he was prepared to act on his far-fetched analysis we may - despite the best efforts of Paul Routledge's forthcoming biography - never know. At any rate, the murderous men of violence of the Irish republican movement decided that they did not need to wait for proof. I've just had to change hotels five times in five days. Why did I bother with five sets of clothes? I saw everyone only once. Always take clothes that are at the end of their life - then you can have the pleasure of throwing them away at the end of your trip. Using my bath washing technique you'll soon have that case down to carry-on size.
If you believe their critics, our noble Lords have proved themselves supreme lords of spin. Yesterday's report on cloning from the Lords select committee on stem-cell research gives the thumbs-up to a technique that, it says, offers 'real and great hope for a range of common diseases'. Yet this was the only possible outcome because it was a 'put-up job', according to the anti-abortion lobby, which says the committee was packed with cloning's supporters. The conclusion is indeed unsurprising, but for a different reason: it reflects the overwhelming weight of current medical and scientific opinion. The cloning issue has been more thoroughly aired, examined and debated than any other in science and medicine in recent years. Official reports have been published by the Human Genetics Advisory Commission, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) and the Chief Medical Officer. All have backed cloning for stem cells (the body's master cells) from cloned embryos or cloned adult cells to produce new tissues for body repair. The courts, too, have had their say. The Pro-Life Alliance claimed in a case last year that there was nothing in British law to stop scientists from trying to create cloned human beings in the laboratory - because the only kind of reproduction controlled under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act was that involving the union of sperm and egg, which is not required in cloning. The judge agreed and an embarrassed Government was forced to rush through legislation expressly banning reproductive cloning. Yesterday's decision by the House of Lords select committee adds little to the debate beyond endorsing the existing legislation. By co-incidence, the HFEA was yesterday considering the first applications for licences to conduct embryonic stem-cell research for therapeutic purposes. The coincidence is interesting and the consensus of opinion is clear - there is much to hope for and, now that obvious loopholes have been closed, little to fear from therapeutic cloning. The UK's regulatory framework is among the most sophisticated in the world and has helped us to avoid the chaotic situation in the US, where the technique is banned in federally funded laboratories but permitted in the private sector. Scientists should be given the go-ahead. Enough talk - let the research begin. The ceasefire in Sri Lanka is a ray of unexpected optimism. The 19-year-long war between the Sri Lankan government and the Tamil Tiger guerillas has been parked in the file marked 'Insoluble Conflicts' for as long as most people can remember. Some of the salient features of this civil war may have stuck in the mind. The Tigers' reputation as one of the world's most ruthless and single- minded terrorist organisations. Their use of cyanide pills to ensure their members were not taken alive. Their early use of suicide bombing, including the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, the Indian prime minister, in 1991. The repeated failure of attempts to negotiate, punctuated by the murder and attempted murder of Sri Lankan politicians. For the past few years, however, this has been a forgotten war. Most of the world's media, this newspaper included, were caught out by the success of yesterday's ceasefire agreement brokered in Norway. For all the inevitable cautions, this is a moment for rejoicing. It is only a ceasefire, with the substantive negotiations yet to take place, but it is permanent and it includes provisions to protect civilians from the Tamil Tigers' extortion rackets and press gangs. If it can be done in Sri Lanka, it can be done anywhere. It is too much to hope that Ariel Sharon will recognise the implications of yesterday's announcement in Oslo for his slide into war with Palestinian guerillas. He prefers to draw a false analogy with the response of the United States to a form of terrorism which, while superficially similar to that of the Tamil Tigers and Hamas, is in fact quite different. The conflicts in Sri Lanka and Israel-Palestine are essentially between ethnic groups and over territory; the motivation of al-Qa'ida is apocalyptic religiosity. As in Northern Ireland, as in Sri Lanka, as in the Middle East, the only way to achieve a lasting peace is by negotiation and compromise. The experience of Northern Ireland, as well as the fate of the Middle East peace deal signed in Oslo in 1993, suggests that there still is a long way to go in Sri Lanka. However, for now, the new Sri Lankan prime minister, Ranil Wickremasinghe, and the Norwegian government, which takes its responsibility for the cause of world peace remarkably seriously, deserve the warmest congratulations. There was fiction by H E Bates and poetry by Cesare Pavese. Renatus Hartogs MD PhD discussed the psychology of hoarding. Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor talked about their stormy marriage. Derek Malcolm reviewed a new film called A Clockwork Orange. Eugene Schoenfeld MD revealed that the principal cause of male insecurity was 'the fear that their penises are not large enough'. There was a special offer of a bikini for œ2.90, and a double-page advert declared that Crimplene was the fabric to capture the mood of spring. From its very first issue, the March 1972 issue, which went on sale 30 years ago this month, Cosmopolitan confounded expectations. It mixed high art and popular culture, and covered diverse subjects - from kissing to getting bank loans if you were a single woman - that had not previously been found within the same covers. The launch editor, Joyce Hopkirk, appealed directly to readers - 'You are that Cosmopolitan girl, aren't you?' - and explained who her target audience was. 'You're very interested in men, naturally, but think too much of yourself to live your life entirely through him. That means you're going to make the most of yourself - your body, your face, your clothes, your hair, your job and your mind.' If brains came last on Hopkirk's list, her readers did not seem to care. The first issue sold out its print run of 350,000 copies by lunchtime; the second was an even bigger success, selling 450,000. Cosmo, as its readers immediately began to call it, had enjoyed one of the most successful launches in magazine history. It became synonymous with the freedom women were enjoying, or trying to enjoy, as a consequence of the sexual revolution. I was one of those original readers. I loved Cosmo, devouring it with the same enthusiasm I felt for The Female Eunuch, which had been published only two years earlier. I was a teenage reader of Cicero and Jackie, T S Eliot and Georgette Heyer, so I wasn't at all discomfited to find Nobel-prize winning novelists and male pin-ups in the same magazine. (Hopkirk engagingly introduced a short story by Alberto Moravia by observing that 'our fiction is a bit tough. But, then, isn't life?') The second issue introduced pictures of naked men, under the not-quite-accurate coverline: 'Our first male pin-up reveals all'. Paul du Feu, who had been married to Germaine Greer, was photographed lounging on the floor, his right leg modestly raised to conceal his genitals. By the late 1970s, when I was working on a local paper in the north of England and pining for London, I used to hang around newsagents, waiting for the next issue to come in. 'You're too cosmopolitan for us,' a colleague once observed, sadly, and I took it as the most enormous compliment. Some of my friends can still recall individual articles from that period. 'How many magazines can you say that about?' one of them wondered last week when we were reminiscing about the early days of Cosmo. It wasn't the advice on sex she remembered, but articles on finance and property, which inspired her to do her own conveyancing when she bought her first house. I remember the thrill of acquiring my first bottle of 'real' perfume, a tiny phial of Diorella, through one of its special offers. Several years later, I plucked up courage to leave my then boyfriend, with whom I had lived since leaving university, after reading an article in Cosmo on breaking up. There were pioneering features on abortion, which had been legalised in this country five years before the magazine appeared on newsagents' shelves; the third issue of Cosmo explained why the new law wasn't working. Hopkirk took the extraordinary step of flagging it up on the cover, naming four famous women who had had terminations. It is this no-holds-barred approach to sex and its consequences that many people still associate with the original Cosmo. Early issues offered '23 Ways To Kiss A Man So That He's Yours For Life (or Long Enough)' and 'Things To Say In Bed'. Ten years later, when Hopkirk had been succeeded as editor by Deidre McSharry, the magazine was maintaining its image with raunchy coverlines. But it also had Jill Tweedie on 'Women, money and the freedom to love', confirming the magazine's commitment both to good writing and the goal of financial independence for its readers. The January 1982 issue offered to 'take the fear out of fellatio', in which the splendidly named Avodah K Offit MD assured readers that oral sex 'requires only the most fundamental intelligence to comprehend or accomplish'. It may not have sounded much fun, but she told them exactly how to do it. These days, the sexual boundaries have been pushed much further: the February 2002 edition of the magazine issue contains bondage tips for beginners - tie your legs with stockings not rope, for example - and sex diaries written by Cosmo readers. Yet the original Cosmo message was never quite as libertarian as it now seems. It flirted with the Establishment, so that Jilly Cooper's 1972 guide to men she imagined would make good lovers included this extraordinary statement: 'On the one hand, I fancy Robert Maxwell because he seems to be so nasty, on the other I adore Geoffrey Johnson-Smith because he's so nice - and think of the kudos of being the Under-Secretary of State for Defence'. It's hard to imagine today's twentysomething Cosmo readers being able to name a junior defence minister in Tony Blair's government, let alone having sexual fantasies about him. Hopkirk herself, in what would now be called her mission statement, revealed a divorce and her share of 'emotional hang-ups'. Cosmo girls were, she thought, prone to 'aggravations like jealousy, envy, and a feeling of just not being up to it that hits us all too often'. In that sense, the magazine was not so much moulding its readers as identifying with them, and sending out mixed messages as a result. The first issue included the confessions of a 'sleep-around girl', and denied that there was anything glamorous about promiscuity. 'If you chip away at the fa‡ade, you usually find a miserable victim of shattered emotions', it warned, 'frantically seeking shreds of affection from man after man'. The second characterised Paul du Feu as Mellors to Greer's Lady Chatterley, describing him as an easy-going labourer who is 'totally disinterested [sic] in Women's Lib or any other political cause'. Another sign that the magazine was not totally at ease with sex was its reliance on American sexologists. You don't need to be medically qualified to explain the female orgasm or how to do fellatio, but Cosmo's contributors tended to have strings of letters after their names, and jobs at American universities. This may have reflected the fact that Cosmo was originally an American magazine, founded by the formidable Helen Gurley Brown, author of Sex and the Single Girl. But it also suggests a need to lend professional respectability to what would otherwise have remained taboo subjects. It may also have reflected the confusion many of its readers were feeling. While the Sixties is fixed in everyone's mind as a revolutionary decade, some of its most long-reaching effects only made themselves felt later. This is particularly true of feminism, which got going in the Seventies and was in many ways a reaction to the maleness of the sexual revolution. Cosmo arrived at a moment when the word 'girl' was already going out of fashion, soon to be used only by male chauvinists or with irony by women themselves; the magazine was both ahead and behind the times, and had a tendency to preach to its readers. But it treated them as people, with the same breadth of interests and ambitions as men. It assumed they could cope with highbrow fiction, and pages of type without the endless cross-heads, photographs and pull-out quotes that are a feature of today's magazines. It quickly lost its ambivalence about feminism, telling readers about the Polish trade union movement Solidarity, and bemoaning its neglect of women. (The author of a 1982 piece about Solidarity, Lynne Jones, was billed as 'a doctor and a feminist'.) I wrote for it occasionally myself, on subjects as varied as Ian McEwan's fiction and the return of the corset as a fashion item. I don't remember precisely when I stopped buying it, but there was a time in the Eighties when I began to feel that Cosmo contained the same articles as all the other women's magazines. It had lost its capacity to surprise, and there were new titles with a different agenda, like Marie Claire, that I liked better. What seems extraordinary, in retrospect, is how long it remained faithful to the original concept. By the beginning of the 1990s, adverts for cosmetic surgery had begun to appear and the layout was changing to look like other magazines. These days, it is more obviously youth-oriented, and displays the same obsession with bubble-gum celebrities - 'Backstage with Britney' - as its competitors. It is a successful formula, currently selling 450,000 copies, but something has inevitably been lost. Today's Cosmo is coarser and less critical, confessional rather than analytical, and nervous about challenging preconceptions. Three-quarters of the magazine's readers would like cosmetic surgery, according to the latest issue, which offers photos of readers who have gone under the knife: 'They're pleased with the results - you be the judge'. Of course, Hopkirk's Cosmopolitan was a product of its time, and couldn't stay the same. The demise of Nova, a stylish Sixties title that was recently revived then closed, demonstrates how the women's magazine market has changed. But what is so striking about the original Cosmo, 30 years on, is how innovative and intelligent it was. It encouraged its readers to be brave, to experiment in every area of their lives, and sympathised with their dilemmas. It may have addressed its readers as girls, but it was definitely a magazine for grown-ups. I thought I'd reached paradise: an empty beach, half an hour from the nearest petrol station and small shop, car-free dirt roads and locally grown fruit and vegetables. A sign said 'Killing hens and perching pullets'. Perhaps you have to kill your free-range dinner yourself. I didn't bother to find out. At the store, my big mistake was to buy the local newspaper, which informed me that Michael Barrymore arrives in New Zealand any day now and plans to visit a local drink and drug-abuse centre. New Zealand is a nuclear-free zone. And they've disbanded their Air Force. Is it too much to ask that they introduce a rigorous new form of vetting at immigration? Anyone who's sold their story to a British tabloid should be refused entry. Then the country would really be pollutant-free.
The case of Ms Susan Wallace, who went down to her local with Igwig the iguana, has lessons for us all that go well beyond the blindingly obvious 'do not take your iguana to the pub'. Ms Wallace, you may recall, has just ended up with a conviction for assault and unnecessary suffering - and not to the iguana. Lesson one is that even half a pint of lager - the amount Ms Wallace was reported to have drunk - has peculiar effects when combined with the presence of a rather large lizard sprawled across your back. Lesson two, which is not altogether discouraging, is that men in pubs have a problem with rather large lizards sprawled across ladies' backs, perceiving them as a threat. Precisely what the men found so threatening about the lizard was not actually disclosed in court. Was it his claws, his tongue, his colour, his reptilian mien, the mysterious smile on his face, or perhaps his female companion? Which brings us to lesson three. When out alone in the evening, you can leave the mace, the pepper spray and the rape alarm safely at home. Just don't forget the iguana - and steer clear of pubs. Poor David Warner. One of the finest actors of his generation, he returned to the West End last week after an absence of three decades induced by stage fright. His return is to be short-lived; after a torrent of terrible reviews, and subsequent tiny audiences, the producers pulled the plug on A Feast of Snails, in which he was performing. Mr Warner's experience is the downside of some very good news. It has always been said that no one lost money underestimating the lowest common denominator of the public's appetite. That is no doubt still true, but after years in which the West End was dominated by musicals or low-brow revues, London is enjoying a revival of the serious play. Even better, most of them are new. Audiences are knocking each other over to book tickets for the likes of Humble Boy, The Lieutenant of Inishmore and Gagarin Way. Producers used to say there was no point in experimenting with new work because there was no audience for it in commercial theatre. That is now clearly wrong. But for every success, there will always be failures. Mr Warner was unfortunate to be in one of them. Better luck next time, Mr Warner. One of the joys of modern Olympic Games is the discovery that yet another unlikely activity - impossible to judge objectively, uninteresting to watch or mechanised to the point of absurdity - is in fact an official medal-entitling sport. To synchronised swimming and ice-dancing we now add the freestyle mˆl‚e for teenagers in search of a drink, the rubber-bullet shooting at moving targets, and, of course, competitive pharmacology, in which participants try to establish if given substances are covered by the ban on EPO. Little wonder the television audience - in this country in any case - has been so attracted to the snooker-like qualities of the peaceful, wholesome sport of brushing ice backwards with a broom. No drugs or violence there, but it is a little disillusioning to discover that the Scottish gold medallists who captured hearts and headlines were helped in their sweeping and stone-sliding technique by computer analysis at the Centre for Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Edinburgh. It seems the tradition of sporting amateurism is safer in the hands of the youngsters trying to storm the Budweiser tent. The rules of war, which America's war crimes envoy yesterday declared obsolete, have evolved over a century and a half in which the nature of warfare has moved from pitched battles to the horrors of international terrorism. The first guidelines were drawn up in 1864 and revised over the years. The conventions remain the most important international instruments for defending human dignity in war. They provide the legal foundation for the work of the Red Cross and have been signed by almost 200 countries. These are the rules that President George Bush's envoy, Pierre-Richard Prosper, now suggests are out of date, as the US administration tries to deal with the aftermath of the international outrage which followed its refusal to allow Taliban and al-Qa'ida detainees the convention's protection at Guantanamo Bay. In the summer of 1859, Henri Dunant, a sometime diarist and sometime merchant, was travelling in northern Italy when he arrived in the small village of Castiglione delta Pieve. Dunant could not have arrived at a more inauspicious time. That day, 24 June, a battle was raging around Castiglione in what would be a decisive episode in the struggle for Italian unification. The French, allied to the Sardinians and with Emperor Napoleon III at their head, faced the Austrian troops, 300,000 men in all, engaged in a bitter and unrelenting battle. By the end of the day, when the Austrians abandoned their positions, more than 6,000 men would be dead and 40,000 wounded in what was known as the Battle of Solferino. Though initially an unintentional observer, Dunant played an important role that day, chronicling the battle and the efforts afterwards by local people to treat the dying and wounded regardless of their allegiance. Working from the church of Castiglione, the chiesa maggiore, Dunant helped local woman as they did what they could with only the most basic of materials. The effect of this young man from a privileged background was so great that it led him to organise an international convention that eventually developed into guidelines for all countries involved in combat. In A Memory of Solferino, published in 1862, Dunant wrote: 'I was a mere tourist with no part whatever in this great conflict but it was my rare privilege, through an unusual train of circumstances, to witness the moving scenes that I have resolved to describe. 'Here is a hand- to-hand struggle in all its horror and frightfulness, Austrians and allies trampling each other underfoot, killing one another on piles of bleeding corpses, felling their enemies with their rifle-butts, crushing skulls, ripping bellies open with sabre and bayonet. 'No quarter is given; it is a sheer butchery; a struggle between savage beasts, maddened with blood and fury. Even the wounded fight to the last gasp. When they have no weapon left, they seize their enemies by the throat and tear them with their teeth.' Dunant wrote of the efforts to help the wounded: 'Every family was bent on having French wounded under its roof, and no effort was spared to console the men for finding themselves far from their country, their families and their friends. The best doctors gave them their care, in private houses as well as in hospitals.' Dunant helped form the International Committee for Relief to the Wounded, which later became the International Committee of the Red Cross. In response to an invitation from the International Committee, representatives from 16 countries and four philanthropic institutions gathered in Geneva and agreed on a basic code to ensure the protection of medical services on the battlefield. This became known as the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field. It contained 10 articles. Later conferences extended the basic law to other categories of victims, such as prisoners of war. In 1899, in The Hague, a second convention was signed, extending the principles to warfare at sea. In 1907 and again in 1929, there were further extensions. In the aftermath of the Second World War, another meeting in 1949 dealt with civilians and prisoners of war. These last two conventions are perhaps the most important. Conventions III and IV offer wide-ranging protection for civilians and enemy forces taken prisoner. These can include 'members of militia or volunteer corps', they say. They add: 'Persons taking no part in the hostilities shall in all circumstances be treated humanely. The conventions say that 'passing of sentences without previous judgment from a regularly constituted court is prohibited' and that the 'wounded and the sick shall be cared for'. They add: 'PoWs shall enjoy complete latitude in the exercise of their religious duties.' Henri Dunant could not have known that his actions more than 140 years ago would have resulted in such a legacy. It is this legacy that Mr Bush's representative, Mr Prosper, is trying to change. A tempting inference could be drawn from recent events: Tony Blair and his advisers may be losing their touch. By no means deficient in intellect, they have been supremely good at manipulation, and their cunning has never been inhibited by addiction to the truth. In the past, however, they have known when to lie: what they could get away with. But their judgement now seems to have deserted them. In his handling of the Mittal affair, Mr Blair has made two elementary mistakes. He forgot that the cover-up can be more damaging than the original offence. He also forgot that politicians should avoid situations in which their conduct can only have two explanations: that they are fools, or knaves. Yet this is where Mr Blair now finds himself. When the Mittal story broke, Mr Blair and Alastair Campbell were instantly aware of its potential for embarrassment. Yet they have often spun their way out of worse messes, and this time they had luck on their side. The story would be competing for coverage with Princess Margaret's funeral. Not only that; they had a plausible defence. 'Romania is trying to modernise its economy,' Mr Blair could have claimed, 'so it is desirable to bring in foreign expertise and capital to privatise and modernise an out-dated steel industry. Britain may not have had a direct interest, but it is clearly to Britain's advantage that everything should be done to bring stability and economic progress to Eastern Europe. Mr Blair might have gone on: 'As for Mr Mittal, he may not be a British subject, but he is a friend of this country. He is also a highly successful entrepreneur. If the Government helps him to help the Rumanians, he might decide to invest more in the UK. The Tories seem to be saying that we should not do business with Mr Mittal. Is this because they are racist, or because they hate successful businessmen? They have questioned Mr Mittal's donations to the Labour Party, but he did so because he believes in a British Government that believes in business. To suggest that he was trying to buy favours is beneath contempt.' This would not have been a perfect defence. The juxtaposition between electoral assistance and ambassadorial assistance would still have left a smell of drains, intensified by Peter Mandelson's success in bringing the Hindujas back to the political agenda. (He will receive no gratitude for that from No 10). But the Blair Government could have provided itself with a plausible story, which would also have made it easier to explain the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's decision to subsidise Mr Mittal. The Government could then have argued that the EBRD shared its assessment. Now, however, the news that the British Ambassador's helpful letter, was reinforced by a œ6m douceur, will appear like the next installment in a tale of corruption. During his rise to great wealth, Mr Mittal must have brought off many financial coups. But did he ever manage to achieve such a rapid 48-fold increase in the value of an investment as when he gave œ125,000 to the Labour Party, and received œ6m from the British taxpayer? The fault does not lie with Mr Mittal. He is just a hopeful, hustling billionaire. It lies with Mr Blair's claims that his Mittal steel was a British company. Unless the PM was a fool, he must have known that this claim was unsustainable. Mr Blair is not a fool; that defence is not open to him. When he insisted that Mittal is a British company, he must have known that he was lying. So what led him not only to lie, but to lie in such a feeble and self-destructive fashion? A simple explanation would be a combination of arrogance and na‹vet‚. Power has gone to Mr Blair's head. A combination of apparently unlimited electoral puissance and an underlying lack of both intellectual self-confidence and political principle has destabilised him. Mr Blair has never been much good at explaining his beliefs; he no long sees why he should even have to try. Recently, as was demonstrated over the 'wreckers' speech on public services, his response to the rough probing and disrespect which are inescapable in democratic politics was a loss of temper. He no longer accepts the requirement to submit himself to any questioning whatsoever. Yet once a premier ceases to respect his questioners, he also ceases to respect his voters. The one set of persons to whom Mr Blair is, if anything, more respectful is the rich. Few prime ministers have ever taken office understanding so little of the British governmental process as Mr Blair did, or thinking less of it. He knew that a lot was wrong with the public sector, but he did not know how to put that right. But he had learnt an important lesson from the Thatcher years, when British business, so long depressed and disordered, had sprung ahead and recovered its status in world markets. From the outset, he was convinced that the answer to any problem he encountered in government was to bring in a businessman to solve it for him. That is a simplistic view. Not all parts of the public service are susceptible to the business approach. Businessmen are there to make a profit, yet governments have to provide services to people from whom no profit could ever be expected. The ethos of business is commercial. To paraphrase Calvin Coolidge, the business of business is business. Yet the activities of government cannot all be reduced to commercial imperatives. There is an inescapable dimension of public service, and of politics. But as Mr Blair demonstrated over his handling of the Rose Addis case, he does not believe that the public is entitled to complain about the services it receives. He is also impatient about politics. If he ever did, he no longer believes that the answer to political questions lies in the rough and tumble of debate. He believes that he is entitled to call in the disinterested expertise of businessmen, and that when he has done so, all debate should cease. This will not work. Most voters understand business better than Mr Blair does. Above all, they understand that businessmen have business interests. The voters have no objections to this, as long as those businessmen do not try to promote their interests by exercising undue influence over government. But it will be hard for Mr Blair to persuade the voters that his business friends do not have access to undue influence. Few public reputations now stand lower than Neil Hamilton's. Yet when Mr Hamilton became a minister, he wrote to Mohammed Fayed and told him that he could no longer involve himself with any aspect of Mr Fayed's affairs. As a result, Mr Fayed turned on him and destroyed him. If Mr Hamilton had written letters on Mr Fayed's behalf similar to the one Tony Blair wrote on Mr Mittal's behalf, Mr Hamilton would not now be a bankrupt and would still be a Member of Parliament. The one inescapable conclusion is that as a government minister, Neil Hamilton was more honourable than Tony Blair is.
As the first phase of the official inquiry into the death of Victoria Climbie drew to a close yesterday, this is perhaps a good moment to recall the words of Lord Laming, the chairman of the inquiry, on the opening of the proceedings some months ago. At that time he said that he hoped that the Climbie case would mark a 'turning point' and that the lessons of the case would result in proper protection for vulnerable and abused children in Britain. Lord Laming is certainly right to hope for such an outcome, but the long list of previous high- profile child-abuse cases suggests otherwise. Victoria Climbie's name joins those of Kimberley Carlile, Jasmine Beckford, Maria Colwell, Shirley Woodcock and many others, all of which had a similar shocking impact on the public and the authorities but, sadly, seemed to have no lasting effect. It is obviously unrealistic to expect that we will never again see a case like that of Victoria Climbie; but it is not too much to ask that the same mistakes be not made time and again by the authorities and voluntary agencies that work in the field. In particular, the Government needs to take urgent action to deal with the standards of some local authorities' social services departments. It bears repeating that the abuse of Victoria Climbie - amounting to the torture and, indeed, the murder of the eight-year-old - took place not in some quasi-prison or care home but 'in the community'. Her injuries were inflicted over a period of many months and were seen by hospital staff and by social workers. Carole Baptiste, the Haringey social worker whose job it was to oversee the Climbie case, was apparently developing a 'serious psychotic mental illness' at the time. Documents have been lost. However, time and again, and far too often, we find with a sense of depressing inevitability that social workers have in some way been found wanting in the discharge of their vital duties. Often it is also the case that the resources are not there to employ sufficient social workers or to attract the best into the field. Sometimes monies intended for the care of the most vulnerable are diverted by councils. Although it is right that ministers should spend so much of their time and effort on setting targets and rating performance in our schools and hospitals, there has long been the feeling that social services have been very much a 'Cinderella' public service. Nor should we be afraid to ask tough questions about race; did the idea that black cultural norms must always be respected contribute to Victoria's neglect? If the Climbie case (and all those that preceded it) is about anything, it is about the need for a thorough overhaul of the funding and staffing of social services departments in every local authority in the country. This has to be undertaken by central government because, as the cynical and obstructive attitude of Haringey Council demonstrates, it seems beyond many town halls to accept responsibility for their failings. At the same time, the role of the NSPCC in this case also leaves something to be desired and should act as a stark warning to all those who feel that a greater role for the voluntary sector, welcome as it may often be, is some sort of guarantee of higher standards of care. Victoria Climbie was referred to a NSPCC family centre in August 1999. The inquiry heard that no effort was made to see the child because staff were preoccupied with organising a party. So let us hope that the Climbie case will mark a turning point for the lamentable standards that seem to prevail in social services. This will need pressure from Whitehall, and so far there is little sign of it being applied. Have I ever mentioned that I come from woodman stock? Not woodman in the sense of wild man from the primeval undergrowth, or hunter of game in the Queen's forests, but woodman as in sensualist of the plank. My father was one of those men who went nowhere without a saw in his hand, a sheet of sandpaper in his pocket and nails in his mouth. A Jew is, by rhyming slang, a four-by-two, but those measurements cut no ice in our house. Two-by-one, that was my father's first love; and for the perfect length of two-by-one - dead straight when you pointed it at the South Pole and cast your eye along its length, so smooth you could sleep entwined around it - he would have swapped his offspring. Fortunately he never found what he was looking for. Perhaps he knew he never dared. The search for it informed his life, though, making him sad and introspective in the end, a haunter of timber merchants and junk yards, someone who went into bookshops only to examine the shelves and who fell into a brown study when we visited relatives who, through poverty or design, lived in uncarpeted rooms. While the rest of us took tea and talked, he would sit with his head between his knees, sizing up the floorboards and cutting them into the ideal dimensions in his imagination. A good job we weren't still living in the forests of Podolia, in log cabins. Unless that was exactly what he was missing. Though no chip off the old block myself - all I ever made after five years of learning woodwork at school was a splint to hold the finger I'd broken while trying to plane a lid for someone else's pencil box - I am still fondly reminded of these my timbery beginnings by the newspaper photographs of those thousands of tons of Swedish pine washed up on the Cornish coast last week: all the firewood in hell, enough matchwood to keep the devil's furnaces aflame for ever. If ever you wondered what conceptual artists were striving for, here, once and for all, it is, constructed with sufficient absence of construction to make every one of them, from the most plainly functional to the most superfluously grandiose - from Carl Andr‚ the bricklayer to old Clingwrap Christo himself - eat their own hearts. Behold every art clich‚ of the last 100 years: the objet trouv‚ with a vengeance, the ordinary become amazing, scale changing meaning, the natural become unnatural, space and volume redefined, litter striving to be beauteous, beauty striving to be litter, the gallery rendered otiose, randomness made magisterial, materials mocking their origin (for here is a towering forest of that which came from forests), and best of all, the artist nowhere to be seen. God the great conceptualist. Charles Saatchi must be looking to sign Him up even as we speak, and Serota wondering how to squeeze Him on to the shortlist for this year's Turner. Can God giggle like a ninny when they offer Him the cheque? God is all powerful. He can do anything. Did He not make Andy Warhol, employing none of the elements we normally associate with life? I would like to think that the Cornish have been out in their thousands, thronging the shoreline to marvel at this glorious sight - art rescued from the wreck of commerce, destruction itself destroyed. But by all accounts they have just been driving to the sea and filling the boots of their cars with offcuts. Perhaps they marvelled first and scavenged later. 'Wrecking' they call this, down there. I lived among the Cornish once and recall more than one occasion when the word went around that there were valuables being washed in on the tide. Out came the torches and the Wellington boots and off we'd all troop, prepared to climb down ropes thousands of feet into the raging blackness, disturbing the homes of screaming sea birds, swaying in the gale, howling, falling, breaking limbs, half drowning sometimes, in order to lay our hands on some punctured sack of sodden tea, or box of Christmas decorations fabricated in Taiwan and now smashed into a thousand pieces. Then up the cliffs we'd haul ourselves again, clasping our treasures to our chests - a shining example of the truism that it is not the winning that matters, but the taking part. And all the following day the village would be alive with tales of our adventures. Such things we'd found down there! Gold and silver. Watches cut from dead men's wrists. Rings pulled from the whitened fingers of society women, still fragrant but destined to cruise the oceans of the world no more. A tiara, no less, seen floating in a rockpool, at first mistaken for a jellyfish. Wrecking is a form of social vengefulness, you see. A way of seeing to it that what goes around, comes around. Imperial Caesar dead and turned to clay, stopping a hole to keep the wind away. A rafter meant for a palace, now a kitchen shelf in Portwrinkle. Though he was no climber, I can picture my father down there on the beach, in seventh heaven, a retractable measure in his hand, a pencil in his ear, perhaps sawing a plank over one knee, something he tried to teach me to do once, until my mother, hearing the saw cutting through cartilage, came running out and stopped him. He didn't mean me to have no legs. He just wanted me to love wood, as he did. What a disappointment I was to him. But it could have been worse. He could have had Andy Warhol for a son. So the politicians, especially Tessa Jowell, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, are worried that the BBC is considering 'dumbing down' its coverage of politics. But few - apart from political junkies such as me - would necessarily blame Greg Dyke, the director general, for looking at new ways of making politics less boring to viewers. The fact is that apathy, reflected at the low turnout in elections, is also mirrored in the turn-off that politics has become for many viewers and listeners. Before the politicians get too high and mighty they should momentarily spare a thought for Mr Dyke as he wonders why so few 'normal' people - especially the young - actually watch his excellent programmes on politics. Don't get me wrong, I am not against the desire to maintain the interest of the viewer in politics, and I think that any attempt to reduce the output of political coverage would be a mistake. In fact, more than that, I also have a financial interest to declare. I am privileged to take part in many political programmes broadcast by the corporation and I would suffer, financially, as a consequence. I find it ironic, however, that I have the opportunity of participating far more these days on radio and television than I ever did as an MP. Maybe that should tell us something. It could be that, tied to a whip, a pager and a political script, I had nothing useful to say. Now that I have to use my brain instead of my pager, perhaps I might appear more interesting. At present, the BBC provides extensive coverage of politics and the proceedings of the House of Commons. I do not think there has ever been a time when there has been so much coverage. Just consider an average Sunday. On television it starts with Breakfast with Frost, and this is followed at lunchtime by On the Record. Meanwhile, Radio 4 provides Broadcasting House in the morning and The Westminster Hour in the evening. Meanwhile, Radio 5 Live offers us Sunday Service. That adds up to five hours of in-depth and extensive political coverage - excluding Radio 4's lunchtime news show, The World This Weekend. For a day on which many are seeking a rest from political debate I reckon, if anything, the BBC is actually going well beyond its call of public duty. During the week, in addition to the regular news and current affairs programmes such as Newsnight and Today, there are other round-ups of events in Parliament. Dispatch Box, on BBC 2, was added to the political stable of the corporation four years ago and provides a 30-minute nightly magazine round-up and also includes robust live studio discussion. Admittedly, this programme is for insomniacs because it goes out after midnight - but then, since Parliament does not adjourn until 10.30pm, it is hardly possible to put out such a programme much earlier. And then there are the two, hour-long, Westminster Live programmes put out on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, which cover Question Time in the Commons and much more. Add Radio 4's Yesterday in Parliament and Today in Parliament plus Saturday's Week in Westminster, and this all points to a pretty impressive coverage for what is, in large measure, just a minority pursuit. If anything, it can be argued, with some justification, that the BBC's output has actually increased in recent years. So no politician can claim that there has been any dumbing-down yet. However, Greg Dyke has a right to ask whether his viewers are actually watching or listening to any of these programmes. There are some (I am one) that say that he has a duty to provide programmes on political affairs regardless of how many are tuning in. But he, in turn, is entitled to ask why so few licence-payers are thanking him for such coverage. Could it be because it is the politicians themselves, rather than the broadcasters, who are dumbing down? Parliament has only itself to blame if its proceedings are such a turn-off. And if some of the programmes go out at an inconvenient time, could this not be because of the inconvenient hours that the Commons currently sits? The trouble is that politicians rarely watch or listen to television or radio and maybe are simply unaware of just how unappetising they appear to the rest of us. One can hardly blame the BBC for wanting to get away from simply covering the proceedings of a largely empty Commons chamber where there are often only a dozen or so MPs present. The only significant thing that registers in the minds of some viewers is the backcloth of empty green benches. Perhaps if MPs attended the debates in larger numbers, there might be more of an incentive to want to watch. Ironically, it has been the provision of the live TV 'feed' to MPs in their swanky offices that has been one of the reasons for the decline in attendance. Then there are the cringe-making Labour stooges who ask their idiotic scripted questions along the lines of: 'Is the Prime Minister aware that he is marvellous?' This week the Speaker ruled that the Leader of the Opposition could not ask the Prime Minister questions about the Labour Party and its funding by trade unions - implying that Mr Blair, as Prime Minister, was not responsible for the Labour Party. This is bizarre. Presumably, this strict interpretation means that Parliament cannot now even question ministers on the leaked Labour Party health policy document that suggests that the NHS might, in future, be less than free at point of use. The attempts to stifle open debate in the Commons mean that, for the rest of us, the impression is reinforced that Parliament is a place where questions in debates simply go unanswered. And when, anyway, so many of the broadcasters are then confronted with the refusal of ministers to appear on programmes, who can blame Mr Dyke for wondering if the manner of political coverage should not be reviewed? How many times do we hear interviewers saying 'We invited a minister to appear but none were available'? In such circumstances it is the politicians' evasions that are responsible for the dumbing-down of their trade. It would be sad if politics were to lose the attention of the BBC, but it is up to the politicians, not Mr Dyke, to make their case.
As ever, market trends are against the way of life of a marginalised community. The evidence of the annual Caravan Show, which opened in Birmingham yesterday, is that the traditional caravan, the wheeled kitchenette that you attach to the back of a car, is being ousted - much in the manner of red squirrels by grey - by the all-in-one mobile home. Caravanners have been a despised minority for too long. They may not have known quite how much they were despised by the drivers of unencumbered vehicles travelling behind their swaying boxes on a motorway, but they sensed that they were discriminated against by the mainstream. And they knew that they were under-represented in Parliament, with only one of their number, Margaret Beckett, in the Cabinet. Mobile homes, meanwhile, have shaken off their image as overgrown camper vans and become fashionable, with the help of air-conditioning, built-in dishwashers and all mod cons. Surely, caravan-owners should react by going in the opposite direction, back to the simpler holiday life that is true to their origins. They could invent a more basic and portable form of accommodation. And call it a tent. Noam Chomsky, one of America's leading philosophers and an icon of the radical left, took centre stage in an Istanbul court yesterday when a judge threw out charges against the Turkish publisher of his book criticising treatment of the Kurdish minority. Bespectacled and mild-mannered, Mr Chomsky cut an unlikely figure in the crowded courtroom where 'crimes against the state' are tried. The 72-year-old linguistics professor watched as prosecutors abandoned earlier claims and accepted the defence argument that Fatih Tas, of Aram Publishing, had not spread separatist propaganda. The charge is often levelled at critics of Turkey's policy towards its estimated 12 million Kurds. Bekir Rayif Aldemir, the prosecutor, said he 'understood the book did not seek to divide the Turkish nation'. Mr Tas faced a year in prison for printing American Interventionism, a collection of Mr Chomsky's political essays in which he accuses Turkey of 'brutal repression' of the Kurds. 'The prosecutor clearly made the right decision,' Mr Chomsky told reporters after the hearing. 'Hopefully this will serve as a step for establishing freedom of speech in Turkey.' Mr Tas, a 22-year-old university student, has six other cases pending against him, carrying a possible 24-year prison term, all for printing articles or books dealing with the Kurdish issue. He called yesterday's ruling 'insincere' and suggested the presence of the professor from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology had helped him escape a jail sentence. 'The case was dismissed, but this is not a sincere verdict, it was given because of Mr Chomsky's support,' he said. No charges were filed against Mr Chomsky. Defence lawyers had asked that he be included as a co-defendant, but prosecutors declined. A vocal critic of US foreign policy, Mr Chomsky said before the hearing that Americans had a responsibility to monitor and protest against human rights abuses in Turkey, which is a close ally. 'When the United States provides 80 per cent of arms to Turkey for the express purpose of carrying out repression, that becomes my responsibility,' he said. The timing of Mr Chomsky's arrival could not have been worse for Turkey. Just a few streets from the State Security Court, where the hearing was held, the Turkish government was playing host to a high-profile international conference bringing together foreign ministers from Islamic and European Union countries. Most of the allegations of human rights abuses in Turkey stem from fighting between security forces and Kurdish rebels seeking self-rule. Some 37,000 people have died in the conflict, which began in 1984. Rebels declared a unilateral ceasefire after the 1999 capture of their leader, Abdullah Ocalan, and an atmosphere of relative peace now prevails. Turkey has started phasing out emergency rule in the mainly Kurdish regions. Also in 1999, Turkey became the first predominantly Muslim nation to join the EU's list of official candidates for membership. But the country's poor human rights record and the refusal to grant its estimated 12 million Kurds greater cultural rights are cited among the chief reasons why entry is continually delayed. Earlier this month, parliament passed a set of human rights reforms intended to help Turkey meet EU standards. The authenticity of a National Gallery Rubens has been called into question again. The last time Samson and Delilah was auctioned, two decades ago, it was the second most expensive painting ever sold. That must mean something. So, apart from the millions of pounds involved, and the reputation of our best art historians, critics and academics - in what way, if any, does it matter? If the most educated experts can't tell for certain whether or not the thing's a Rubens, why should we art-proles worry? What does it lack, this almost perfect copy, or fake, or homage, or brilliant pupil's effort? What's the difference? What's the difference, indeed, between a perfect copy and its original? And what else are Monday mornings for than to consider the nature and value of art? First it must be said, perfect copies of oil paintings are impossible. Your old masters are just too peculiar. I don't believe much about art but I do believe that. It became clear for me at a Frick exhibition of Rembrandt self- portraits. We were kept back from the canvasses by a red rope a couple of feet from the wall. You could lean in and inspect the paint as close as you liked, limited only by the length of your nose. And in doing so, something very odd happened. Rembrandt's eye which had been so eloquent, so real, such a representation of a real eye, disappeared when you saw it from four inches away. It only reappeared when you leant back an inch or so. You leant in and the eye exploded, becoming a mess of specks, slashes, splashes, splodges, spiral lines. Its components were chaotic. You leant back and there it was, harmonious and full of meaning. Well, blank despair at any rate. There are more fakeable artists. In Orson Welles's film F for Fake, we saw the great forger Elmyr de Hory at the easel. Casually, in half-a-dozen brush strokes, he'd make a Matisse and then throw it on the fire, a Chagall and throw it on the fire, a Picasso and throw it on the fire. Acting in this capacity, de Hory was a marvellous craftsman rather than an artist, but the product, what was that? What effect would de Hory's Chagalls have had on gallery experts, on connoisseurs, on ravished collectors? In what way would the quality of their experience be different from that provided by the original? All the aesthetes who've sat in front of Samson and Delilah over the years, working themselves up into a lather over the brushwork, what will they say if and when Rubens is declared innocent of the painting? They who have been moved, who claim to have been changed, how will they reconcile their new state to this betrayal? Picasso regularly used to be to be asked to authenticate works that were sold as his. He always refused ('There are too many Picassos around,' he said. 'It depresses the price.') One time, he was told the piece he'd condemned as a fake was indeed from his own hand. 'Sometimes I fake Picassos,' he said. That's an interesting idea. When he imitates his own mannerisms, he fakes himself. Yes, there is something in a masterpiece that speaks to us across the generations. The second- rate, or the third-rate, the brilliant copies and the awful fakes reveal themselves in time. A Madonna and child forgery from the 1920s became obvious, quite suddenly, 50 years afterwards, when the similarity between the Madonna and Clara Bow was observed for the first time. It is one of those media friendly terms that covers up a multitude. Alcohol- related illnesses. This week we were told that these illnesses are in danger of destroying the NHS and are responsible for 33,000 deaths every year, and that eight out of 10 people attending emergency units have alcohol related injuries. In a society that encourages us to escape pain rather than face it, alcohol is the favourite anaesthetic. Yet alcohol related illnesses doesn't have the 'oh my god', scare-you-witless, let's-find-a-cure-fast resonance of a word such as cancer or leukaemia, nor is it loaded with dread like the phrase sexually transmitted disease. How many people hear alcohol-related illness and think of a sick head in the morning, a transitory discomfort that will be gone by afternoon? Before I get going, let me enter an all too important caveat: I am not remotely anti-booze. God bless good wine and beer and whiskey, 'beakers full of the warm south with beaded bubbles winking at the brim and purple stained mouth' etc. Or as Flann O'Brien's 'poet of the people' put it when eulogising Guinness stout in the comic masterpiece At Swim Two Birds: 'When food is scarce and your larder bare, and no rashers grease your pan... a pint of plain is your only man.' If you can drink and not succumb to one of those mysterious alcohol-related illnesses, the best of luck to you. But if you are one of those whom booze seduces and then betrays, if you spend your days and nights chasing the warm rainbow, then this week's news should be very scary indeed. Are you the one in company who is watching the wine bottle and wondering whether the others will think it odd if you order another and then saying to hell with what they think? Or the one who sees a friend leaving a glass of wine unfinished and wonders what in God's name is wrong with them? Maybe you are the guy who wakes up and for a few terrifying minutes has no earthly idea where he is or what he did last night, or the woman who rolls over and looks into the face of a stranger and wonders if she will be able to get up and get dressed and escape before they wake. And if you have known that morning where nothing lifts you - not beer or wine or whiskey - then alcohol-related illness is already with you. It's screwing with your head and in time will get around to your body. That poor body. There's no end of misery that alcohol can bring. Liver, pancreas, heart, bowel slowly poisoned to death. That's usually well under way before the exterior starts falling apart: before pissing blood and the yellow pallor and parchment skin; before the amputated leg or the body immobilised by a stroke; before the brain reduced to mush from all those tides of booze washing over it down the years. I have been to the funerals of many friends who have fallen into alcoholic death. It is never, ever an easy death. Scrub from your mind forever the notion of a romantic drunkard's death, disregard every admiring profile you read of the rebellious drunken singer/poet. I read that rubbish and think of a man who choked to death on his own vomit, a man who died of heart failure and wasn't found for a week, the beautiful woman with an angel's voice found bloated and poisoned on her kitchen floor, a man who died far from those he loved in a small room in a town where nobody knew him. Every one of them left people behind burdened with the question: why? Alcohol-related illnesses. If you have ever visited a hospital for alcoholics on a weekend when the kids are visiting, you'll have seen the illness in its saddest and most cruel form. Take a lawn full of drunks and their families and contemplate the fact that at best only a quarter will recover from alcoholism. Regard every alcohol-related illness as a huge stone cast into a small pond, as a family broken and bewildered, made sick too by the disease in its midst. I agree with Alcohol Concern; there is no bigger health crisis facing Britain. Yet we remain curiously indifferent to the damage done to family life and the immense burden being placed on the health service. Ask any recovering alcoholic and they gladly accept that responsibility for their sobriety is theirs alone. But that is the rationale of a person who has made the first vital step towards recognising that a problem exists. The first obstacle is the chronic denial around alcoholic illness. It is everywhere around us, the elephant in the sitting room we refuse to acknowledge. Hardly a family in the land is unaffected by the problem - most people know a cousin or a friend who battles with booze - yet there was a sense of shock when this week's statistics were unveiled. It is difficult for families to face up to the issue in a society that is awash with denial. Booze is embedded in our national rituals, the socially acceptable drug. Far easier to rave on about heroin and junkies than to face alcohol addiction. Popular culture celebrates drunkenness (for a good example of what I mean, witness the moronic behaviour trotted out on ITV's Holiday Reps programme each week). We ban cigarette advertising from television but allow the continued flogging of booze. We have high-alcohol drinks cynically aimed at the most vulnerable - I mean imagine the marketing strategy behind Special Brew. Just who is the target market? I can think of two immediate candidates: the young and the poor with little money who want to get pissed fast, and the alcoholic chasing oblivion. When victims of alcohol abuse get sick they find a medical system woefully ill equipped to deal with the crisis. Alcohol Concern carried out a survey last August that found that 71 per cent of doctors and nurses interviewed felt they had insufficient information to help dependent drinkers. You might imagine that, with alcohol costing the NHS œ3bn a year, politicians might express a sense of urgency. But like the rest of us they are cocooned in denial. This isn't a crisis that can be solved with drugs. They can help you out of detox, but meaningful treatment depends on skilled counsellors. Right now we have a chronic shortage of hospital places for those suffering from alcoholic illnesses. We dry out the drunks and put them back on the street and they come back again and again. Many find their way into the criminal justice system. Not just the street drunks banged away for being drunk and disorderly, but also the businessmen and women hauled off to the cells because they've trashed the house or committed an assault, the man who kills in the middle of a blackout. I normally rush for the door when I hear a politician or civil servant droning on about 'co-ordinated strategy'. But the scale of damage being done by alcohol- related illness demands action across the widest range of areas. It means a huge increase in funding for alcoholism treatment and research and a willingness on the part of political leaders and the media to end the denial. We must talk about this stuff that kills so many, bring the healthcare professionals, the criminal justice system, the media and the drinks industry into a public debate. To the millions caught in the middle of this nightmare, something better is owed than the present dishonest shambles.
Rather as Basil Fawlty couldn't stop talking about the war to his German guests, so Peter Hain, the Minister for Europe, finds it almost impossible to stop talking about the euro, even though he knows he shouldn't. In a conversation with Le Figaro that can hardly fail to inflame the Treasury, Mr Hain has just floated a detailed timetable for potential British entry into the single currency, pointing to a referendum in the spring and autumn of 2003. As it happens, Mr Hain's remarks were not part of some plot to soften up British opinion for entry. Today Jack Straw travels to The Hague to make an important speech on the future of European institutions. In it the Foreign Secretary will set out some of the latest British thinking in advance of the Convention due to begin at the end of this month under the chairmanship of Valery Giscard d'Estaing. It was hardly in the interests of Mr Hain, as the senior British representative on the Convention, to do anything to distract from his boss's focus on the daunting exercise in constitution-building in which he will be taking part. What's more, Mr Hain didn't really confide in Le Figaro anything that isn't a very open secret in Whitehall, namely that a working hypothesis exists that would allow a euro-referendum as early as spring 2003. And while what Mr Hain said wasn't really new, some of what Mr Straw says today will be. True, the intriguing idea of, in effect, a full-time President of the EU, at the very least complementary to the Commission President, is floated as an option in terms so opaque as to be almost invisible. But others, such as rotating the presidencies of the ministerial councils, which cover subjects ranging from agriculture to the environment, every two and a half years, and making those council chairs an 'executive board' responsible for the day-to-day running of the EU, are substantive. And what will shine through is the British belief that it is the ministerial and prime ministerial councils that must be strengthened. While there are also ideas for entrenching the European Parliament's rights of scrutiny, it is the councils, composed of representatives of elected national governments, which in British eyes principally give the EU democratic legitimacy. But if Mr Hain's Fawlty-style tic did not produce anything new, it was a reminder, if needed, of how difficult it is to stay silent about what everyone agrees is by far the biggest decision the government will have to take in the coming year - whether to call a referendum on the euro. It does not reflect a change of policy, which remains in favour of entry in principle but only if and when Mr Brown's five economic tests are met. However, what it does reflect, perhaps subconsciously, is a subtle but perceptible change in the weather. It always used to be said (subject, of course, to the tests) that Mr Blair would call a referendum on the euro if and when he thought he could win. That no longer has much meaning, if it ever did. First, it implies a greater detachment on the Prime Minister's part than is justified. By all accounts, Mr Blair wants it enough to take what he believes is a justifiable risk. He isn't persuaded by the argument - shared by a few in Downing Street and many more in the Treasury - that it would be better to wait until 2006, perhaps, by which time the euro would be such a fact of life that the British people would sleepwalk into it. He is, it is said, much more sympathetic to the argument that to wait until then would sap Britain's credibility in Europe; would reduce, perhaps fatally, Britain's chances of filling the leadership vacuum in the EU, and would make it more difficult to reshape policy (not least, to take one topical example, on the over-rigid stability pact, which Gordon Brown has rightly inveighed against). But, above all, he is said to be increasingly optimistic that he could win in 2003. What's more, it looks as if Mr Blair is right. It's not just that there is gradually increasing polling evidence that once the Government - assuming it has the necessary support of Mr Brown - had recommended entry, there could be a majority in favour. It's also that further detailed preparatory work strongly reinforces it. In particular, focus-group research for Britain in Europe suggests that, apart from a substantial hardcore minority of opponents, the thirst for information on EMU - and the public's willingness to take the Government seriously as providers of it - is great (just as with, say, Aids or the millennium bug). I yield to no one in my scepticism of focus groups. But this is much in line with what any reporter on the road during the general election could hear with their own ears. Self-declared opponents of entry, if pushed, would say first that they didn't 'know enough about it' and, secondly, that 'no one is really making the case for it'. The qualitative research suggests that some of the pro-euro messages - from avoiding 'isolation' to enjoying lower prices - play very powerfully. Mr Hain, a veteran of the Welsh referendum, knows all this. One counter-argument is this: supposing Mr Blair became unpopular and the referendum became one on his premiership, rather as the French Maastricht referendum was on Fran‡ois Mitterand's record. Well, given that Mr Blair's popularity remains undented after the pounding he has had in the last few weeks, it's difficult to see how this would happen. In that sense ministers may be right when they say that the press may be less in touch than they are. That isn't to say a referendum would not be a gamble - albeit a sensible one. If the Cabinet were to hold - an unprecedented event - a substantive meeting on the issue, there would probably be a majority in favour of doing what Mr Blair wanted because he wanted it. Margaret Beckett appears to be a striking, if tentative, convert. But there are caveats. Firstly, there are strong ministerial voices arguing - for example - that an EU-wide interest rate could leave higher taxes or spending cuts as the only inflation-fighting weapon, thus jeopardising all Labour's promises - an argument that could resurface in a referendum. Secondly, euro-entry is not exactly a priority for other Cabinet ministers. Focused on their departments, they aren't yet geared up for the fight But the big caveat is Mr Brown. Whether and how he moves from his present deep caution remains the most fascinating question in British politics. By all accounts, the Big Meeting between the two is yet to happen. But while Mr Blair - whose enthusiasm is well attested - is a necessary condition, he is not sufficient. Now, it is the Chancellor who is both a necessary and sufficient condition for entry. There is a link between all this and Mr Straw's speech, even though he will not dwell on the euro. Firstly, because a Europe on the lines that he will suggest could make euro-entry more congenial to the doubters. But, secondly, because he will offer a robust defence of the EU and of pooling sovereignty to achieve domestic goals. But that should not disguise the central fact. The key issue is no longer so much one of agonising over whether the British people can wear it but of what is the dynamic within the Government. There are more important things in life than Cate Blanchett's breasts, but not many. All the Australian film star had to do was turn up at the premiere of her new movie last week, wearing a revealing dress, and the column inches filled up as if by magic. Admittedly Blanchett was wearing a nice frock, unlike most of the models who took part in London Fashion Week - skin jewellery and a bearded lady were two of this year's highlights - but a photograph of her cupping her breasts was enough to prompt fevered speculation. Had Blanchett dropped a cup size, so to speak, as a result of pregnancy? The film's producers must have been delighted, as their star effortlessly extended the free publicity they had already received. The contemporary fascination with women's bodies is a gift to anyone who has something to sell. At the same time, it is a strange feature of a culture that could reasonably be described as obsessed with breasts that we seem to know very little about them. I have not had children myself but even I know that childbirth produces physiological changes. So do the contraceptive pill and getting older, which explains why the female population is buying bras in larger cup sizes than it did 20 years ago. Yet Blanchett's appearance in a low-cut dress prompted trawls though picture libraries for 'before' and 'after' photographs, as well as confessions from other famous mothers who had experienced this alteration. It may be that, in an era when women's breasts swell and shrink on the tables of cosmetic surgeons, we have forgotten that changes in breast size are a natural phenomenon. To be fair, almost as much excitement was generated last week by Kylie Minogue's bottom, which was on show in a fetching mini-dress at the Brit Awards. In recent weeks, columnists have been wheeled out to explain why we like Kylie so much more than Britney Spears; she has even been hailed as a symbol of everything the Taliban hated about the modern world. This is quite a weight for Minogue's diminutive frame to bear and it suggests that the more women's bodies are on display, the more they need explaining and decoding. Of course this is something to do with the fact that most women don't look like Blanchett or Minogue, and tend to be in a state of permanent anxiety about their appearance. We no longer know what 'natural' women look like, but movie stars and models are no more representative than the ordinary women who are involved in a daily struggle to control their weight. In that sense, even the most perfect female body has become a plethora of signs, pregnant with the prospect of its own disintegration; famous women in their twenties are studied minutely for signs of cosmetic surgery, anorexia, weight gain or an unannounced pregnancy. The inspection is clinical enough when the women are young - Blanchett is 32 and gave birth to her first child in December - but positively lethal when they get older. Spotting the signs of ageing has become a spectator sport: Princess Diana was only 36 when she died but royal watchers had already detected dimpled thighs, while Nicole Kidman and Jerry Hall were both accused of committing the sin of cellulite last year. What is so unpleasant about all this is the atmosphere of blame in which it is carried out, as though getting older is a lifestyle choice made by lazy women rather than a natural process. Kylie may have a perfect bottom at 33 but she won't in 15 years' time, as columnists will delight in telling her. When bad people do evil things, then those who profit most are other bad people: it's like they have a sort of arrangement with each other. We have already seen the Israeli government of Ariel Sharon taking advantage of last Tuesday's attacks in New York by invading Palestinian areas and murdering their citizens more or less at random. Of course, with the impeccable instinct for public relations that Palestinians have always shown, some of the silly bastards allowed themselves to be taped celebrating the events at the World Trade Centre - there's one fat woman in ugly specs whose witless, grinning gob will stay with me for a long time. But then 50 years of poverty, humiliation and cruelty do not, amazingly, automatically make you into a good, kind or sensible person. However, I am left wondering, given how much circumstances always seem to conspire against the entirely reasonable cause of the Palestinian people, whether they wouldn't be better off in the end just jacking the whole thing in, giving up, closing the business, shutting up shop with the whole looking-for- justice thing, because it's not really working out, is it? Yasser Arafat might be wise to issue a statement saying something like 'Look lads, we've given it a good go, but every time we think we're getting somewhere then some bloody thing happens which strengthens our enemies and puts us back to square zero. I mean, I know our only crime in the first place was to be somewhere where a load of people from Europe wanted to be, but there's too many powerful forces ranged against us, so all of your mates at the PLO high command have decided we're going to knock the whole protest on the head. From now on we're going to let the Israelis push us around, steal our land, destroy our homes and we're going to let them do it without a bleat of protest. From now the Fateh supreme council can be contacted via a bed and breakfast hotel in Dover. See you around, Yasser, Hanan and all the gang.' Seeing the destruction wrought in the United States, watching all the various odious factions scrambling for advantage, unable to understand anything except their own twisted point of view, made me think what a nasty, dangerous species we really are. Though human beings have the manual dexterity to manufacture all kinds of complex machines, our brains don't seem to have evolved at the same pace as our fingers, so that what we have in us is a creature with the basic mentality of a coyote but with the ability to create all manner of terrible weapons. A while ago, The Sunday Times asked me to take part in selecting photographs taken from 50 years of the Magnum photographic agency: the theme was to be 'celebrating the human spirit'. Along with others, I was to select six pictures and to write my comments, in hand, on the back for later publication in the magazine. However, when I came to look at these black-and-white images, what I saw was a species so in love with itself and totally blind to its faults. I remember I chose one image of Mother Theresa and wrote, 'From what I've read about this woman she was a rather nasty piece of work. In this photo you can see the self-indulgent vanity shining out of her. As they say on The Jerry Springer Show, 'she think she all that but she ain't'.' Other pictures were meant to illustrate the supposed miracle of yet another child born to clog up the planet. Funnily enough, The Sunday Times chose not to print my pictures or my comments. All they wanted was gooey stuff about the indomitable human spirit, the fantastic wonderful specialness of our maggoty little species; they didn't want anybody wondering whether the planet wouldn't be a lot better off without us screwing it up. I know that James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger are currently working on the third in the Terminator series of movies. Maybe in this latest version the heroes should be SkyNet, the computer that wants to wipe out mankind, and Cyberdyne Systems, manufacturers of the killer Cyborgs. After a titanic struggle, John Connor, the leader of the human resistance, is defeated and our kind is wiped from the face of the Earth. The machines convert themselves into singing cappuccino machines or fly off to explore other worlds or miniaturise themselves until they are the size of an atom and the planet that formerly housed us begins to heal itself. The rainforests start to regrow over the shattered landscape, cute, furry, almost- extinct animals emerge to sniff the air and to repopulate, the seas again teem with life, the skies grow dark with birds. And maybe, when you think about it, George W Bush might be arranging that situation for us right now.
The money ain't the problem. It's what you do with it. The developed world has taken on board the task of rebuilding the shattered economy of Afghanistan and has just pledged $1.8bn (œ1.3bn) in the first year to this end, with a total of $4.5bn over the next few years. That is already nearly half way to the UN target of $10bn - although the World Bank reckons that $15 billion will eventually be needed. The task now is to make sure that the money does not disappear down a black hole and that there is a viable economy that can sustain a decent standard of life for its people when the aid cheques run out. Can it be done? Afghanistan ranks at or about the bottom of the world scale on most conventional measures of human endeavour, insofar as figures are available at all. Life expectancy is 42.5 years, 25 out of every 100 children die before they are five, 70 per cent of the population are undernourished and only a third of the adults can read and write. It is, in that unpleasant expression so often used nowadays, a 'failed state'. If it can come right, that would be a wonderful demonstration to the rest of the world that out of catastrophe can come, if not triumph, at least a modicum of success. The first thing to appreciate is that there are clear limits to what outsiders can achieve. Consider the money now pledged: it is tiny by the standards of developed countries but enormous by the standards of Afghanistan. The whole $4.5bn, of which the UK's share is $288m, is less than the British taxpayer spent last year in eradicating foot- and-mouth disease. Put another way, we spent four times as much on the Dome as we are spending on Afghanistan. But relative to the Afghan economy, the money is big. There are no reliable statistics for its GDP, but it is probably about $20bn a year. There are some 25 million people, but per capita income is only around $800, 20 per cent lower than in neighbouring Tajikistan and only half that of Pakistan. So the aid flow will be more than 5 per cent of GDP per annum - and a lot more in the first year. That ought to be enough to make a material difference to the country's wellbeing. But it has to be a lasting difference. Some day the cheques will dry up and the expensive consultants in their white Range Rovers will go back home. In any case these are proud, independent people who would not want to live off the meagre handouts of Western aid agencies, even if these continued to be available. It would be nice to think that the various Western 'experts' from the World Bank and other agencies were going to be more successful at encouraging self-sustaining development here than they have been in, for example, most of Africa. But their track record is discouraging. Are there any reasons to suppose that, 10 years from now, Afghanistan will be seen as even a modest success? Actually, I think there are. But it will be largely because of them, not us. We know enough about economic development to realise that there are several necessary but insufficient conditions for success. There has, for a start, to be physical safety. It is not just that wars are immensely destructive of wealth, which of course they are, but conditions of lawlessness greatly raise the cost of any economic activity. There is no point trying to create a business if the proceeds are liable to be stolen; local people don't bother; and potential outside investors have plenty of other opportunities and stay away. It now seems a reasonable assumption that there will be a period of reasonable order, or at least conditions where order is possible. That creates a climate where contracts can be made and enforced, where titles to land and property are respected and, therefore, where businesses can be allowed to develop. Next, the basic physical infrastructure has to work adequately well. If you have power cuts it becomes impossible to run the basic essentials of a modern economy, such as computers and faxes. Roads have to be passable in bad weather; the water has to be on; the airport has to be functioning; flights have to be at affordable prices; and, of course, health care has to be adequate too. Again, there seems a reasonable possibility that most of this physical infrastructure will be fixed to an acceptable level in the next five years. There is also a reasonable possibility that living conditions will be sufficiently attractive to encourage skilled people to return to Afghanistan to run the infrastructure, something that is just as important as basic reconstruction. Next there has to be a functioning state, performing core services and able to collect taxes to pay for these. There has to be a functioning banking system, enabling and encouraging savings and lending in order to finance economic activity. This, too, looks set to happen. So it is possible to be reasonable optimistic about these necessary but insufficient conditions for economic recovery. To a fair extent these are problems that money and technical help can solve. But ultimately whether the country is successful will turn on other, less easily generated - and less easily identified - qualities. These have to come from within. On the face of it the country seems short of things (opium poppies aside) to sell to the rest of the world. It will gradually have to find these. There are some obvious possibilities, for example ecotourism and the export of traditional craft products. The economy will be supported, too, by emigrants' remittances and has, in the diaspora, a body of skills and contacts that could be of enormous help in the future. But all experience of successful economic development is that it is impossible to plan success. Instead you have to remove blockages to development, spot market signals that suggest that there is an opportunity, and then try and reinforce it. The greatest reason for hope, though, is what has been happening in the last few weeks. Within a few days of the end of hostilities, there was a burst of economic activity. Shops opened, trading began. Despite extraordinarily difficult circumstances, the economy got going again. This is an enormously encouraging signal for Afghanistan. Who could quibble with the new measures that usher in electronic tagging for persistent child offenders awaiting trial? Not police chiefs, who have been pleading for ages for just such a system. At last, they have got their wish and pilot schemes will commence in six areas in eight weeks, going nationwide in June. Senior officers' complaints have focused particularly, but far from exclusively, on London - presently in the grip of a crime wave. They estimate that up to 30 young offenders acting as if they are immune to the law are operating in each London borough. Each time they are arrested and put on bail, they apparently get straight back out on the streets to commit further crimes or to intimidate witnesses. They are adept at playing the system, and often do not turn up for their trials, so new dates have to be set and witnesses lose interest. Now, instead of simply releasing them prior to their trials, the courts will be able to order tagging. The suspects will then have to wear ankle bands linked to a unit in their home and connected to a computer. The control will be backed by a night-time curfew. The great - and undeniable - advantage is that it is far, far better than nothing. Which right now is all that courts confronted with an innocent-until-proven-guilty child can offer. One could be forgiven for being under the impression that dealing with this very problem - of persistent young offending - was one of the main pledges that got the Blair government delivered to power in the 1997 election. The solution then, as I recall, was fast-track custodial sentencing. Is this new move, then, simply confirmation that the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act has not worked? It would seem that way to the cynical observer, who has been hearing about how persistent young offenders flout the law for years. But in fact the reduction in time between arrest and sentencing targeted by the government was reached and outstripped some while ago. As for the custodial sentences - well, the youth prisons are full to bursting, conditions in some are terrible, and they are worsening. Retributive punishment is being exacted in this country at a faster clip than ever, often against the same people, again and again and again. More prisons are being built at a cracking pace, even though the success of the Government's moves to tackle young offending so far have proved one thing beyond doubt: prison does not work. If this sounds like a contradiction in terms, it isn't. If all goes well - and despite appearances it still could - the new prisons will not be supplementing the old Victorian ones, but replacing them. And God knows those grim, disgusting, ancient institutions need replacing. They need replacing with more liberal institutions, in which the emphasis is not on punishment but rehabilitation. And the institutions that are having the most success with young offenders are the ones doing just that. For decades public feeling has been stirred up against the very idea of 'soft options'. But it is the practical options that work. A young offenders' institution in Reading, for example, scored a hit simply by cottoning on to the fact that the South-East was crying out for fork-lift truck drivers. Training 50 young offenders resulted in 70 per cent of those on the course finding work on leaving prison. Only three have reoffended. Compare that 6 per cent to the 80 per cent of 14-16-year-olds who reoffend and the efficacy of retraining becomes obvious. And tagging, despite its bad press, can work just as well. The trouble is that it's not much good on its own. Tagging works as part of an ISSP (intensive supervision and surveillance programme). These have been up and running for some time, with educational courses, drug rehabilitation and schemes in which reparations are made to victims. ISSPs, though, will not apply in the short term to the children affected under David Blunkett's new measures. They will have to wait until they are convicted for the mercies of practical help and expert training to enter their lives. And it is that great irony that sums up the impasse between right-wing and liberal attitudes to young criminals, as well as the internal contradictions held within the left-liberal view. The right howls about the unfairness of the most anti-social of young people being the ones who get most help. They continue to bay for blood despite the fact that their tough, punitive attitudes have been in the ascendancy for decades now. They do not want offenders to be helped. They want them to be made examples of. But at the same time, the left is at fault for a different reason. Liberals, while insisting that young offenders receive education tailored to their needs, are the first people to complain when it is suggested that helping children vulnerable to drifting into crime might be more sensible at an earlier stage. Training young offenders to be fork-lift drivers is lauded, while offering children or entire schools courses in which vocational or practical skills are taught alongside academic ones is viewed with distrust. What a weird, unhelpful contradiction this is. Yes, it is unfair that disturbed children get the attention they crave only after they have become criminals. But the right-wing answer - denying them this - is wrong. Likewise the conservative call for difficult schoolchildren to be put into 'sin bins' is wrong. What isn't wrong, though, is realising that many very young people in this country need the kind of guidance that ISSPs can offer before they even break the law - or are caught doing it. I'm not suggesting here that difficult children should be treated like young criminals. Instead I'm suggesting that young criminals should be treated like difficult children. The strategies for dealing with young people who are not coping with the education system as it stands should be similar whether or not they have committed crimes. It is mad for an institution on the 'inside' to be considered loonily liberal because it offers manual job training and drug rehab, and one on the 'outside' to be labelled a 'sin bin' because it can offer lost youngsters similar help. The annoying thing is that the Government appears to know this. Its policies point rather lamely in a direction whereby this happy state of affairs might be achieved. But again and again, this Government ducks the real business of politics. Instead of winning hearts and minds, it prefers to take the coward's way out and spin its not-too-liberal policies so that they appease, rather than inspire, those on both sides of the political divide. The result is not quite, but something akin to, entropy. Instead, unbelievably, the police, the judiciary and the prison system are blamed for rising crime. Isn't it pretty obvious that without crime we would not need these institutions at all? They need to be viewed as part of the solution, not part of the problem. To this end, they all need reform - the judiciary being the only one that has ducked it, and the one that needs it most. But these are merely the bodies that deal with the human detritus we call criminals. It is our wider world that makes them. Diaries exposing the secret life of Kurt Cobain, the Nirvana singer who killed himself eight years ago, have been sold to a publishing house for œ2.8m. Cobain's estate, which is managed by his widow, Courtney Love, struck the deal with Riverhead Books, a US subsidiary of the British media giant Pearson, after fierce bidding. The journals, which are said to include frank accounts of Cobain's battles with depression and heroin addiction, are likely to be published this year. Cobain, who was 27 when he killed himself in 1994, began writing his diaries when he was a teenager and continued during his to fame. James Barber, who assists Ms Love in managing the estate, told an American newspaper yesterday that the diaries contained 'really cool stuff'. There are revelations about encounters with groupies and a handwritten draft of 'Smells Like Teen Spirit', which took the Seattle grunge band to the top of the charts. There are also lists of Cobain's favourite records, rules he set for the band and letters from fans. Although the publication is bound to provoke renewed speculation about the life and death of the controversial star, Mr Barber insisted the estate was conscious of protecting his reputation. 'He's not here and [our] responsibility is to promote his creativity and his legacy,' he said. Julie Grau, editorial director of Riverhead, part of Penguin Putnam, said: 'The journals are an intimate portrait of an artist of great influence.' They were a vital source for Charles Cross's biography of the singer, Heavier than Heaven, after he was granted access to them by Courtney Love. She has provoked much criticism before and since Cobain's death in 1994, standing accused of manipulating him in life and then exerting unreasonable control of his legacy.
When I was about 20, I worked in an office. Every morning there would be that little joke, where anyone who arrived five minutes late would say 'Morning' and everyone would call back 'Afternoon'. The next joke would come at about 11, when the boss would take his coffee cup across to the sink to rinse it out. Every day he'd say, 'Just going off to wash my thing - ha ha ha.' And every day I wished I had the guts to wait five minutes, say 'Just going off to wash my thing,' then walk to the sink, get my knob out and scrub it with a dishcloth. Like most office workers, I never had any idea of the purpose of my office, though the supervisor does his best to make out the job is extremely important when you first get there. 'Well it's a pleasure to have you with us as a vital part of the team. You'll be sitting here, with Harold, and every morning the newspapers will be delivered to your desk here. Now your job is to go through all those newspapers, one by one, very carefully indeed, and colour in the Os. Be very careful not to do the noughts in the sports pages, and when you've finished, hand them across to Harold for authorisation.' And poor Harold, who's been there 54 years, will say, 'Cor blimey, it's like a madhouse in here sometimes. We were in here until 20 past seven one night, you know. The evening newspaper had a big article about Yoko Ono going up the Orinoco, you see.' Recently, for the first time since, I've been commuting to an office again, and I realise that I'd forgotten the most important aspect of the whole business. It starts with getting the train, which has been at least 10 minutes late every day except once. But a new trick has been added. At London Victoria, the Underground gets so crowded that a giant yellow light flashes and a siren wails with the sort of noise you'd expect to hear if aliens invaded. Then a huge metal shutter is drawn across the entrance to stop anyone getting in, for up to 20 minutes, and a crowd of several hundred builds up. One morning someone lost it, as if it was a trench in the First World War, and yelled 'That's it, I'm going in!' and squeezed round the gap to charge through a line of security guards and make a break for it. It felt like the rest of us should shout, 'Oh my God, Tommy's cracked,' and 'The fool, he's going over the top!' Instead it was more like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, with the rest of us thinking 'Don't fight it. Be like us and accept it, then there's no more pain, just a numbness that's quite pleasant once you're used to it.' And that way you become a commuter, each day's journey indistinguishable from the next, so that you notice the tiniest differences. 'Aha', I thought one day, 'I must be slightly later than yesterday, because the busker is at the end of 'Hotel California' whereas most days she's only just started.' But some things are different from before. To get into this office involves a series of checks, guards and airport-style bag searches that make you wonder whether you've come to an underground military centre to work on a secret spaceship. I saw someone who'd worked there 10 years being searched 'to see if they were carrying any forks', because 'we have to be careful since 11 September.' Because you can't be sure that a middle manager hasn't been playing a long game, slowly getting themselves promoted to reach a position where they could run amok with a fork in revenge for the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. Not only that, but in order to repeat the havoc of 11 September, this unlikely operative of the Berkshire faction of al-Qa'ida would need to have perfected the technique of getting offices to fly. Besides which, inside the building is a huge canteen containing about fifty million forks. Once inside, nothing can be done without a note or a permit or a laminated card. A memo came round one morning to tell us that 'today between noon and one o'clock, you will receive a visit from the internal window cleaner.' You start to worry about saying 'I'm just nipping to the toilet' in case someone in authority says, 'First you'll need to go to the fourth floor and visit the slash department to get your khazi warrant validated.' In some ways, office work is as class-ridden as anything from the 19th-century, because its main purpose appears to be to wreck your self-esteem. The worst thing about spending all day being shunted from broken-down train to overcrowded Tube to bureaucratic mini-metropolis is how it makes you feel utterly worthless. It makes you wonder whether sheep were originally super-intelligent creatures who ruled the world, but after a few centuries of being herded across fields in groups of several hundred, one by one they all gave up and thought, 'Oh sod it, I might as well stare in a gormless trance until someone mercifully sticks me in a stew.' If hell does exist, I think it almost certainly contains a corner devoted to pointless discussions. Under satanic coercion the damned will be obliged to sit for eternity discussing whether nature is more important than nurture or whether screen violence leads to imitative behaviour. And, if you've behaved with particular vileness, you will be forced to join the endless debate about the state of the British film industry. Quite a few people will be doing this voluntarily this week - provoked by the Bafta shortlist of nominations for best British film, which this year includes some titles that seem to stretch the definition a little. Chris Columbus's Harry Potter and Robert Altman's Gosford Park are packed with British A-list talent, but both are directed by Americans and financed almost entirely with American money. Surely, the sceptics will say, this is the kind of smash-and-grab raid that the best British film category was designed to prevent. The award has always had a smack of the consolation prize - as if it were one of those Tried Jolly Hard stickers that the more anxious schools give out on sports day, so that slow boys aren't discouraged. But what's the point of cordoning off a section of the trophy table, if Hollywood can just lean over and rake in the cups? Bafta's definition of Britishness turns out to be pretty straightforward. If you qualify for government tax relief as a British film then you qualify for this section. Since the rules are that a film only counts as British if more than 70 per cent of its budget is spent in the United Kingdom and more than 70 per cent of the payroll goes to European and Commonwealth talent, you can see that there's a concept of nationality here that is more all-embracing than that generally adopted by the UK immigration service. But Bafta's approach to this matter strikes me as perfectly sensible - or at least properly insouciant about an essentially trivial matter. Besides, there really isn't a workable alternative. While there might be a popular prejudice in favour of the 'who pays the piper' approach to establishing national pedigree (if the Americans foot the bill then it's an American movie), it very quickly runs into trouble. Bridget Jones's Diary, for instance, could credibly be claimed as a French movie by those lights, since a large chunk of money came from Studio Canal. Follow the money and you could claim that Peter Greenaway makes Dutch movies and Ken Loach Spanish ones. It doesn't help to call for the travel documents of the producer or director, either. Is Black Hawk Down a British film simply because Ridley Scott can walk through the fast track at Heathrow passport control? Or should A Room with a View be regarded as quintessentially Indo-American because its producer (Ismail Merchant) comes from Bombay and its director (James Ivory) from New York? More importantly, who cares, apart from the production accountants who must squeeze every last drop out of the smallprint? The truth is that the patrimony of a film - amorphous and debatable -- is probably the least interesting thing about it. Cinema has always been a medium that thrived on the genius of immigrants - in this country as much as in America. What would Hollywood have been without Schmuel Gelbfisch (the young Polish boy who later adopted the fabulously aspirational name Sam Goldwyn)? What would British cinema be without Korda and Pressburger? To those questions we might legitimately add another one. What would American cinema be without the legions of British economic migrants and gastarbeiters who do their time in the Hollywood hills? It's time to recognise that Britishness has been so successfully exported that Britons can no longer claim a monopoly on its virtues. Of late I have begun cutting my own hair. Before this, up until a few months ago, I would go perhaps twice a month to my barber, Gino of Marchmont Street, London WC1, to have my hair trimmed by clippers on a No 1 setting, with my beard cut slightly longer. However, for several years now Gino's has been getting more and more popular. I don't know if this has anything to do with a number of extremely attractive women from around the world working there. Is it a sort of timid man's lap dancing? I couldn't say. Whatever the reason, occasionally I would have to wait a long time before I would get to sit in the chair for the few minutes that it would take to have my own sparse bonce done. Now, I am an extremely busy man, a popular and gregarious individual who is surrounded by a large and vibrant family who keep me on the go 23/6, as they say. The fact that just at this moment I am sitting alone in a dingy basement apartment, the dank room lit by a single light bulb, on the day after Boxing Day, dining on some stale crackers and able to devote the whole day to writing 800 words to fill in for Howard Jacobson at a moment's notice is merely a statistical anomaly. Whatever, I felt I didn't have the time to sit around waiting my turn so while I was in Spain I purchased a set of electric clippers and set about myself in the bathroom. At first the result was a revelation to me; as far as I could see my haircut was as good as I had been getting from the professionals over all these years. 'My God!' I thought to myself, 'I've been squandering seven pounds a month!' Not to mention all the effort I'd put in to walking painfully up and down Marchmont Street leaning on a Zimmer frame to qualify for the OAP discount, now revealed as a terrible waste of time. My do-it-yourself haircut seemed to be a confirmation of an idea that had been at the back of my mind since the time I started losing my hair to male-pattern baldness. A bald man like me often harbours resentment about spending money on tonsorial elaboration since it appears an essentially pointless exercise. Or sometimes we baldies can go the other way. For example, there was a previous editor of this newspaper who was as bereft of hair as I, yet who would visit the society trimmer Trevor Sorbie on average about once a week, which - knowing the prices that Sorbie charges - must have worked out at about œ15 a hair. So now I thought I was saving myself both time and money. I had a neat haircut while freeing up the time I would have spent at the hair salon to do more important things, like download different tones for my mobile from the internet and dribble spittle on the dining room table. Yet after a few days something strange happened to my previously uniform haircut (and I suspect this is where the skill of the professional hairdresser lies). Where there seemed to be an evenly cropped skull, there suddenly appeared clumps of ragged hair (which I had missed when I had been peering in the mirror) along with completely smooth, irregularly shaped bald patches (which took much longer to grow back than the surrounding hair), bloody scars and cuts and long, springy, cable-like black hairs that sprouted from the dome of my pate. And frankly, God knows what's going on behind me. The other day, while I was walking past the Dalston Mosque in east London, an angry crowd of worshippers began to form in my wake, and a growing mob followed me for quite some distance, muttering furious threats and imprecations, until I was forced to jump on to a bus. Piecing together what they shouted at me afterwards led me to believe that with my clippers and a wobbly hand I may inadvertently have carved various foul obscenities in Arabic script onto the back of my skull. In the end, I have nobody to blame but myself. I thought that I didn't need anybody else, I thought I could do it for myself, I was arrogant and vain, and as a result I am now forced to go out only at night, to slink through the streets of Bloomsbury with my hideous visage covered by a long, black hooded cloak. Also, since I have had time to dwell on it (though I admit I am perhaps obsessed), it strikes me that, in the past few months, isn't that in a way what the US has been doing - cutting its own hair? Since September, the US has in essence, despite the convenient cloak of an alliance, been acting on its own, unilaterally, with no recourse to the collective advice and wisdom of those who know a lot more about the situation than the US does or who will suffer the consequences of the US's actions. At the moment we are in the first days of the new haircut, everything looks uniform and smart, but in the coming months there is no knowing what strange lumps and excrescences will appear, what bald patches or ugly springy hairs will sprout, what obscenities will be written. Or everything might turn out OK. The fast-food giant McDonald's was taken to court yesterday by dozens of people who claim to have been scalded by their hot drinks. The 36 victims, most of whom are children, claim that the cups used by McDonald's were not suitable and that the tea and coffee was too hot, the High Court heard. Timothy Horlock QC, representing the group, said children were particularly at risk from being scalded, with at least 16 claimants aged four or under at the time of the accident. 'This is not surprising since, according to the defendant's own statistics, 60 per cent of accidents to their customers happen to children under 10,' Mr Horlock said. He said the company's marketing strategy was designed to attract young customers. He said many people did not realise the drinks served at McDonald's were often far hotter than at home. 'There was no expectation on the part of the general public that a burn from one of these drinks could result in injuries needing skin grafts,' Mr Horlock said. Mr Horlock told the preliminary hearing that McDonald's was aware of the danger and was negligent in not taking measures to protect its customers. He said the average temperature of drinks served in McDonald's machines ranged from 75C to 90C. McDonald's is contesting the action. In 1994, it settled a case with a woman who claimed she suffered serious burns after spilling coffee bought from a McDonald's in New Mexico. She was awarded $2.9m (œ2m) by a jury, which was reduced to $640,000 (œ450,000) on appeal. The hearing continues today.
The renaissance in children's literature is turning out to be one of the most striking cultural characteristics of our times. Whether we are reassessing the achievements of the past, as with the film of The Lord of the Rings, or falling in love with current child-heroes like Harry Potter, there has never been another time when children's literature could command such attention. About six months ago I wrote on these pages that Philip Pullman's novel The Amber Spyglass would be a worthy winner of the Booker Prize. In the event it didn't make the shortlist, but it lived to fight another day. On Tuesday night, Pullman walked away with the Whitbread Prize. That prize thrives on the neat concept of first dividing books up into categories - novel of the year, children's book of the year, and so on - and then breaking down the categories for its overall prize. That meant that these judges could give the award to Philip Pullman without being accused of dumbing down to the level of a children's book. Peculiarly, this still seems to be a very real fear. Although we are currently seeing such an unexpected outpouring of energy in literature for children, many commentators are still afraid to admit that these books can stand alongside other literature. Novelists such as Philip Hensher and Howard Jacobson have mocked the adults who eagerly turn the pages of the Harry Potter books, or, even worse, queue up to see the film without the excuse of a seven-year-old child by their side. And when Peter Jackson's film of The Lord of the Rings was released, sceptical critics such as Mark Lawson, Thomas Sutcliffe and David Sexton poured scorn on people who took their childish delights into adulthood. They seem to believe that people who sink into tales that shrug off the adult world are absurd, or even a bit dangerous. In one critic's words, we are proof of 'the infantilisation of adult culture'. But these critics who are proud to be too sophisticated to enjoy a book where a bear talks or a dragon flies might be missing out. They needn't be afraid that they will lose their critical edge if they let down their guard against childish things for an instant. Do we still have to spell it out? It really is possible to like Rowling and Roth, to enjoy Pullman as well as Proust. What is endearing about the new breed of children's writers is that they are firing a new bolt of energy into literature. Na‹ve? Yes, they may be na‹ve. But what they don't suffer from is the deadening claustrophobia of so much acclaimed literature for grown-ups. Readers who fell on hyped novels such as Jonathan Franzen's The Corrections or Margaret Atwood's The Blind Assassin, only to find them imaginatively underpowered, will know what I mean when I say that even the biggest novels today can seem much smaller than life. Still, perhaps those novels honestly reflect the problematic aspects of our current condition, whereas the children's writers have the liberty of escapism. That may be true. But sometimes it is worth going on these journeys - not just to escape, but also to return. I'm sure I'm not alone in saying that after stepping into Rowling's world or into Pullman's world, both of which thrive on the staggeringly precise and sensual detailing of their fantasy universes, I found that the everyday world had juddered a little. Without doubt they do lack other qualities that you look for in literature that isn't meant for children. But still, Rowling and Pullman can achieve that precious effect on the reader of tearing away the veils of familiarity and reawakening one to the oddness and beauty of ordinary life. And let's not sidestep what is, perhaps, the most obvious point of these books' appeal. As with J K Rowling, Pullman fulfils an often unassuaged longing in this secular age - he describes a great battle between good and evil, a battle where everything is at stake, where you have to take sides. For some people this is just too simple to be enjoyable. They recognise that morality is always about shades of grey, and they don't like being seduced into these grand images of deep black and dazzling white. But I find this engagement with ethical themes intriguing. And Pullman's moral vision is the most refreshing I've seen in a children's book for a long time, because unlike so many others, he does moral fervour without falling into a sub- Christian message. On the contrary, his work contains the most impassioned cry to accept the death of God since Nietzsche. No wonder Christians have shied away from his books. The Amazon website, where readers can post opinions, contains hundreds of reviews from the United States, many of them from parents who call his vision 'satanic' and 'dark and terrifying', and warn other families off them. The same can be heard here. Claudia Fitzherbert wrote in a newspaper yesterday: 'Christian parents beware: his books can damage your child's faith.' Indeed, they can. Many writers who have tried to preach their atheism in their literature, like writers who have tried to preach their religion, have ended up weakening their vision. But here the loss of faith is made vivid and energetic. The thrust of the trilogy that is completed by The Amber Spyglass is to re-run the Fall, but this time sexuality and knowledge are good, and authority is bad. The priests and the church are the embodiment of evil. The aim of the child protagonists is hardly unambitious - it is to destroy the dream of the kingdom of heaven, and instead to put one's faith in building the republic of heaven in one's own lifetime. Isn't this is a great vision for the world after 11 September? Here we have a book that asks us to believe that we can build a new, highly moral world without the precepts of religion. Sure, Pullman ends up having his cake and eating it. After all, a fantasy that includes angels, witches, embodied souls and the possibility of movement between parallel worlds is hardly a secular universe. This is still a children's book, and it retains comforting, childish elements - so it can alleviate the dreariness of rationalism with magic flowers and talking bears. Nevertheless, it's fascinating that such a book has found such an audience now. We have all learnt not to ask writers to give us any moral messages. With most literature that works perfectly, because it makes us alive to irony and imagination without boxing the work up with moral preconceptions. But Pullman is actually asking his readers to engage with him ethically as well as imaginatively. He says wonderfully old-fashioned things like: 'Blake once wrote of Milton that he was 'of the Devil's party, without knowing it'. I am of the Devil's party, and I know it.' Pullman celebrates beliefs that should be central to the world we want to build now - beliefs in equal sexual love, in suspicion of authority, in free thought and in a connection with the environment. His sales and reputation suggest that many readers are absolutely entranced by fiction that can mint such brilliant coinage from the dusty moral currency of our age. And even those people who deplore the so-called infantilisation of adult culture would go a long way to find anything else that has such power to make us think and wonder. Open a kitchen drawer in any home, and they will spring out at you like a jack- in-the-box. Go to any beauty spot, and you are sure to encounter a few, trapped among the plants like giant insects or flapping noisily in the wind. Floating in the local river or blocking your nearest storm drain, plastic carrier bags are an unsightly and environmentally degrading fact of modern life. The Irish government took action yesterday, imposing a tax of 15 cents (9p) - dubbed the 'plastax' - on single-use plastic shopping bags, payable by the shopper, not the shop. In Britain, supermarkets were considering whether the green levy might eventually cross the Irish Sea. Environmentalists, meanwhile, were estimating how far the annual consumption of 12 billion bags would fall if it did - and whether shoppers might change their habits if they had to pay for the environmental consequences of their actions. The notion was given a tentative thumbs-up last night by the Secretary of State for the Environment, Margaret Beckett, after a meeting in Brussels with her European counterparts. 'It's an interesting idea,' she said. 'We are in close touch with our Irish colleagues on environmental issues, and though it's not something we have in mind, we will watch the results of the Irish initiative with interest.' There is no doubt that the Irish Republic has a problem with plastic bags. The idea of a surcharge on every carrier bag, whether given away or sold, was first floated in 1999, but it has taken until now to implement. Even this introduction was delayed from 1 January because the government feared that bringing in such a measure and the euro on the same day would be too much for Ireland's consumers to cope with. Ireland's bag tax is expected to raise more than œ100m annually, which will be channelled into environmental schemes. But Bobby Malloy, the Environment minister who first suggested the idea, was clear about its aims. He said yesterday: 'The primary purpose of this levy is not to generate revenue, but to change consumer behaviour. 'I want to see a significant reduction in the use of plastic shopping bags and a subsequent reduction in the number of bags that end up as litter.' The only exemption in Ireland's shops and supermarkets are the so-called 'bags for life', sold by many supermarkets for the equivalent of 10p, which are replaced for free when they wear out. Indeed, many Irish supermarkets reported a brisk trade in these last weekend. On this side of the Irish Sea, a number of groups are watching developments closely. The environmental group Friends of the Earth believes it could be significant. FoE spokesman Mike Childs said: 'Innovations like this will hopefully focus people's mind on reusing plastic bags, and reduce the amount of unnecessary waste that is so easily created. We will follow its effectiveness with great interest.' It might seem obvious that if you charge people for something which they used to get free, they will use it less. The same logic underpins the proposals made a week ago by the Commission for Integrated Transport, to charge British drivers not for car ownership or petrol use but by road usage, based on demand. Plastic bags can be recycled, but only about 0.5 per cent ever are, despite schemes such as that operated by Sainsbury's, which gives a 1p refund for every bag that is reused. Shredded and compacted, they can also be used as bedding for roads and in the construction of buildings. Yet plastic bags represent only one part of the complex overall waste problem, according to both environmental groups and those who make the bags. At the British Plastics Federation, the watchword is restraint. The BPF's senior adviser on industrial issues, Marcia Gick, said: 'A survey in Australia found that cigarette butts caused four times more litter than plastic bags.' The survey was done by weight. And, she added, the Irish have a very different problem from us in the United Kingdom. They have a large rural population, and a very bad record on waste collection and disposal.' The Irish counterpart of the BPF lobbied, unsuccessfully of course, against the plastax. Now the BPF must consider whether it might arrive here - although Ms Gick is quite confident that it will not. 'The only other European state which taxes plastic bags is Denmark, which has a tax on all packaging - and a similar problem to that of Ireland, with a big rural population and not enough recycling. And there have been complaints from other European Union states that the tax creates a distortion in the market and so is against EU rules.' However European states have found a variety of ways to encourage recycling. In Belgium, supermarkets encourage re-use of their carrier bags by crediting shoppers with points on their loyalty cards. In Finland, supermarkets pay a levy on the amount of plastic bags used, with the proceeds funding recycling. Germany has been making advances in recycling for years. In 1991, store chains there were ordered to pay a levy to a recycling company, in return displaying the Gruner Punkt (green dot) on their products. Plastic bags have to be bought at the checkout for about 30p, though environmentally-friendly shoppers prefer cloth or wicker bags. The Dutch are keen on recycling their carrier bags. They incinerate the bags in accordance with strict environmental rules and use the resulting energy to heat hospitals. Other states, such as Portugal and Greece, are, like Ireland, laggards in the recycling stakes. For members of the BPF, any tax on carrier bags is sure to be bad news. But environmental groups feel that they are absolutely the way to go - setting up the way for a radical clash of objectives in the years ahead. In fact, for Mr Childs at Friends of the Earth, taxing plastic bags barely begins to scratch the surface of the problem - which in Britain is huge, but largely hidden from our daily sight, just as we tuck those bags away in kitchen cupboards and drawers. The problem is this: by 2020, according to an EU Directive that the UK has agreed to, we must only send one-third of our waste to landfill. That means either recycling or incinerating the other two-thirds (or, since landfill space is running out, especially in the south-east, even more). But incinerators are unpopular, at least with the people who have to live near them. So the answer is to recycle. And Britons do far too little of that. 'Our fear is that governments put forward ideas for problems which are high-profile, but aren't part of a decent waste recycling strategy,' said Mr Childs. 'The Irish, we hear, want to burn all their waste to meet the 2020 Directive - so we think that this plastax is more like a diversion from what needs to be done, and from their dirty waste disposal schemes. 'And if you look at how much it would actually cost to introduce here - you would have loads of civil service time taken up with consulting with shops, and then drafting legislation, and then with chasing shops to see how many plastic bags had been sold.' The plastax might actually turn out to be a profitable scheme for unscrupulous shopkeepers - which will keep the Irish Customs & Excise on its mettle. So what is the real solution? Friends of the Earth say it is much closer to home than the checkouts: 'Ensure that every household has access to a quality doorstep recycling scheme.' At present we recycle 11 per cent of our household waste. While that has increased from 8 per cent a few years ago, it is still a long way from the 66 per cent needed. 'Without decent recycling facilities, people across the UK will continue living next door to polluting incinerators and filthy landfills,' says Mr Childs. 'Then you could charge people for the household waste that they don't recycle. That has been introduced in the US and Canada and has been very effective in getting people to cut down on their rubbish. It encourages people to think more before they buy stuff with lots of packaging. That's what we really need in this culture.'
Lesley Monk, a 51-year-old from Burnley, explains to Mark MacKenzie why she and her team of huskies are going flat out to conquer the wastes of Alaska. While you are reading this, Lesley Monk is taking her dogs for a walk. Sixteen of them in fact, and not just for a quick once-round-the-park. All being well, the 51-year-old personal trainer from Lancashire is now one day into an 1,100- mile trek across the frozen Alaskan wilderness, the only British competitor in this year's Iditarod, the most demanding dog-sled race on earth. While the winner of an event billed as 'The Last Great Race in the Last Great Place' will be sipping victory champagne in front of a roaring fire inside of 10 days, Lesley and the other 67 mushers can expect several weeks on the trail, which will push them to the limits of their endurance. Polar bears, fragile river-ice and temperatures regularly below -60C are just some of the optional extras on a tour itinerary that requires sleep on the move as well as hours spent massaging weary canine shoulders and feet. The race takes its name from the village of Iditarod, one of 26 checkpoints along the way as competitors race from Anchorage in the east of the state to Nome in the west, a rerun of an historic journey. In 1925, a Nome doctor wired Anchorage pleading for medicine for an outbreak of diptheria. With no other transport available, teams of mushers transported the serum in a dramatic relay across the frozen tundra. The patient was saved and, conveniently for the logo writers, the legend was born. None of which explains how, for the third time in 14 years, a former hairdresser with a dysfunctional lung finds herself racing some of the hardiest backwoodsmen in North America across their own back yard. Lesley's first encounter with a husky, Alaska's working dog, was with one owned by a friend she was visiting in New York in the mid-Eighties. 'In England, we were living on a farm in a highly touristy area,' she explains, 'On holiday, we were greeted by this gentle dog that looked incredibly fierce.' Deciding huskies were an excellent way to dissuade tourists from wandering up their drive, Lesley and her husband, Roy, tracked down a breeder in Britain. 'The breeder explained the husky was a working dog, and only let me take one away on condition that I worked it. Three times a week, I would drive to the outskirts of Leeds and run the dog with a team behind a cart.' The Monks' obsession with the highly intelligent breed saw their canine family swell to 20 and eventually led them to Alaska and, via smaller qualifying races, to Lesley's first Iditarod in 1988. 'I was a total rookie and was pretty overwhelmed by the whole thing,' she says. 'I had one absolute dread, that I'd finish last and be out there in the wilderness all on my own.' Which is precisely what happened. Nineteen days after leaving Anchorage, having struggled to cope with the pace and physical demands of the race, Lesley crossed the finish line to claim the Red Lantern, the wooden spoon. 'I was devastated to finish so far back and I loathe talking about getting the Red Lantern. But with hindsight it was the best thing that could have happened, because now on the trail, there are very few things that phase me.' Her disappointment over her 1988 placing emphasises the fiercely competitive nature of the event. Lesley's next outing was in 1990, when she was forced to scratch after her sled and team went through thin ice attempting a river crossing. 'The water was only thigh deep, but my sled sank and the dogs were in the water, getting tangled up in their gang lines. The problem was compounded by the following teams, who were jumping over us to get across and were getting tangled themselves.' While Lesley insists there is camaraderie between the mushers, competitors will only come to another's aid if a situation is life-threatening. Given that leading racers have also been known to confuse the chasing pack by removing trail markers as they pass, this clearly isn't the London Marathon. But then $50,000 (œ35,000) in prize money is a hefty sum in outback Alaska. And bearing in mind that only four of this year's field are of Alaskan descent, $50,000, it seems, is a lot money everywhere else. The Iditarod was first raced competitively in 1974, when it was won by Dick Wilmarth in 20 days. Around a dozen dogs died through exhaustion, the result of poor nutrition. Races since have had huge teams of vets, and the death rate has fallen to below four dogs per thousand. While the Humane Society of the US have been trying to get the race banned for many years, race vets rightly contend that the death rate is about equal to that in a sedentary canine population. And animal welfare has certainly progressed from centuries past, when native Alaskans tethered husky bitches in woodland to mate with local wolves. If the wolf chose to mate with, rather than eat, his blind date, the outcome would be a litter of working dogs with a wild toughness. 'All the attention is focused on the dogs and nobody really cares about you,' Lesley explains. 'The rules state that the sled must have the capacity to carry an injured dog under cover, as well as demanding one compulsory 24-hour rest and two eight-hour breaks at checkpoints. These are on top of the camp breaks we take out on the trail. People who don't know these animals have no idea what they are capable of. Their speed and stamina are breathtaking, and if you get the right balance of personalities in your team, you can really fly.' While the demands on the dogs are immense, the demands on the mushers are equally daunting. 'If the team is down for eight hours, the dogs are resting, but you're constantly working, rubbing ointment into cuts on feet, massaging joints, preparing food,' says Lesley. 'When you set off, you're exhausted and the dogs want to run like the wind.' And the treats in store back on the trail are many. Mushers need tremendous aerobic fitness to be able to scoot, skateboard style, with one leg on the sled for long distances. Should conditions become sticky, scooting turns to old-fashioned running to maintain the most prized weapon in the musher's armoury, momentum. Standing still for extended periods also places tremendous strain on the arms and back, and should you take your eye off the trail at the wrong moment, you could wind up with a smack in the chops from an overhanging branch. And unless your screams carry across miles of wilderness, you're in trouble. Yet despite the hazards, Lesley is undaunted. 'I keep going back because I love it,' she says. Shopping, sure, but culture? Can this Gulf state offer anything other than golf courses and gold souks? Wake up to a different view. It is early in the morning. I look out of the window and see below me the clear, calm turquoise waters of the Gulf. Above me, the sky is already pale blue. Between the turquoise and the pale blue, a haze of mother of pearl wreaths the city that stretches out from the shore in the pale, silky colours of an expensive negligee. The spires and towers of Dubai's astonishing architecture stretch up out of the mist like some fantastic palace from the Arabian Nights. Even what I later discover is an industrial installation looks like a fairytale fortress in this light. It's difficult to believe that it won't melt away, like a mirage, or a vision. Vision. It's a key word here. Modern Dubai exists, you will be told, thanks to the vision of Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the father of the present ruler, Sheikh Maktoum. His farsightedness created a Gulf state that is no longer dependent on the profits from oil but is a world centre of business and trade. Dubai's visions come on a grand scale and they take physical shape with remarkable speed. You want two man-made islands shaped like palm trees, each with 40 miles of coastline, housing 40 hotels, 2,000 luxury villas, etc, etc, etc? Construction begins next year. You want to turn a shopping mall into an entire city, complete with parks, children's playgrounds, hotels and apartments? Consider it done. My vantage point for this dawn view of the city is a 361 metre (1,184 feet) high hotel, shaped like a boat and looking like a spinnaker. It rises from the sea on a man-made island, while a second hotel, shaped like a cresting silver breaker, lies like a bow wave beneath it. This is the seven-star Burj Al Arab. Completed only three years ago, it is already an icon. It deserves iconic status, I think. It's a beautiful building, almost organic in feel once you are inside, with its layers of floors rising up, tier upon tier, like the interior of a beehive or a strange seed pod. At the top is what looks from a distance like a glass envelope, the Al Muntaha restaurant, with its stunning views across the Gulf, while below the hotel, accessed by a 'submarine ride' lift, is the Al Mahara seafood restaurant, whose walls encase vast aquaria. To say that the interior of the Burj is lavishly exotic is like saying that Coco Chanel designed the odd suit. It is quite startlingly luxurious. There are no rooms, only suites, of which mine was a very lowly variety. It was about as big as my Edwardian terraced house (just a one-bedroom suite, you understand). The bathroom toiletries are HermŠs and you get given bottles and bottles of the stuff. (You can tell who's been staying at the Burj: they trail around in a cloud of 24 Faubourg.) Everything is done by remote control, including summoning the butler. Ours was called Francis, and he carefully explained how to use the interactive controls to open and close the curtains and so on. Of course, I forgot all this the minute he left the room and spent about half an hour trying to open the living-room curtains. Eventually, I retired upstairs to bed to find that I'd opened the bedroom curtains instead. The bedroom was so far away (up an impressive curved marble staircase, past a gigantic chandelier) that I couldn't hear the hum of the mechanism. The Burj was a fabulous experience. I'm ashamed to say that I felt a tiny twinge of guilty relief when I transferred to the Jumeirah Beach Hotel. This is the one that looks like a cresting silver wave and it's a very jolly place, full of very jolly families doing very jolly beach holiday things. The beach waiters even offer to clean your sunglasses for you and there is not a lager lout within 1000 miles. (As for the curtains, they are operated by the usual pulley mechanism.) Bliss. It is early in the morning. The sun is rising vast and red through the murk of an incipient sandstorm. I'm on my way to the Oasis stables, near the Nad Al Sheba racecourse. Suddenly, on the outskirts of this City of Gold, I see the ancient currency of Arabia making its majestic way across the sands. Camels. Scores of them, some ridden by tiny boys, are heading for the camel racetrack, a circuit so vast I cannot see the other side or even each end. (When the race is in progress, the spectators have to follow it in a flotilla of four-wheel- drives.) We halt as the camel caravans cross the road ahead with that distinctive swaying camel gait. But if these are the sultans of swing, the thoroughbreds at Oasis are the sheikhs of the sport of kings, aristocrats whose bloodlines are as ancient as their owners'. The Oasis stables are part of the Godolphin racing empire, owned by the Maktoum brothers, Sheikh Rashid's sons. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum is the prime mover in the enterprise, making history in the Nineties by overwintering his British-bred horses in Dubai and winning a string of classic victories. We are shown around the stables by trainer Nick Robb. Nick is a world expert on racehorses, but if he ever decided on an alternative career, he would make a good living as a tour guide. He's a natural. His audience is rapt as he outlines the science that goes into making a horse run from A to B in the fastest possible time. At the end of the stables tour, we are taken to the racetrack to see the grandstand and tour the jockeys' quarters and the stewards' room. This is where the Dubai World Cup, the world's richest horse race, will be run on 23 March. Entry to race meetings is free, and there's no gambling. But who needs a bet when you can watch the result of centuries of Arab equine expertise come thundering down the track? It is early in the morning. A falcon hangs in the sky high above the desert before stooping in a heart-stopping dive for its reward. Here and there, Arabian oryx nibble the shrubby plants that form defiant grey mats in the sand. I bend down and rub the leaves between my fingers. To my English gardening hands they feel bereft of any moisture or goodness. But Mitch, our South African field guide, assures me that the oryx thrive on their diet and points to where tiny yellow flowers have bloomed, a response to a short-lived shower the night before. Falconry is an Arab tradition: the birds are pictured on the Dubai currency, the dirham. In his book Arabian Sands, about Oman and the Empty Quarter, the explorer Wilfred Thesiger describes hunting bustard with peregrine falcons on camelback, accompanied by a pack of salukis. He tells how an Arab falconer could have a bird ready to hunt in a fortnight to three weeks. At the Al Maha, they have both peregrine and saker falcons and the birds are fed on quail bought from the supermarket. 'The guests don't really want to see things being killed,' Mitch says drily. Al Maha means 'oryx' and the resort is another vision made reality. Set in 10 square miles of desert nature reserve, it is designed to resemble a Bedouin encampment. Even the oryx have appeared as if by the wave of a wand: reintroduced after being hunted to extinction. (Thesiger doesn't like the term Bedouin; he says it's a double plural and the correct term is Bedu. He and his 'Bedu', of course, accounted for quite a few oryx.) The general manager, Tony Williams, is a South African ecologist who believes, refreshingly, that the secret of running a successful hotel is good manners. 'You should treat people as if they were a guest in your house,' he says. Each guest chalet is arranged to give maximum privacy, with its own deck and plunge pool. The interiors are luxurious, but they are as understated as the Burj Al Arab is spectacular. There's no Harrods-on-ecstasy glitz here, but a wooden easel in the corner, complete with paper and pastels. It would be wrong to imply that you don't receive a warm welcome elsewhere in Dubai. At all the hotels, regardless of their architectural idiosyncrasies, there is smiling courtesy. Even in the Emirates Towers Hotel, a tall, sharp pencil of a building that seems to encapsulate in glass and steel Dubai's go-getting, onward-thrusting character, the service is unfailingly friendly. However and I'm sorry to labour the Arabian Nights analogy there is something magical about the Al Maha. It has something to do with the pace of life, the change of focus. Apparently, many people come here for only one or two nights. I was told, before I came, that I wouldn't want to spend more than a night as 'there is nothing to do'. I easily could have spent a week at Al Maha. Hell, I could have spent a year. Before dinner, I sat on the terrace and watched dusk fall over the desert. The dry fragrance of frankincense, from an incense burner nearby, lingered on the warm, still night air. If only HermŠs could capture that and put it in a bottle.
At present I am trying to write my first serious novel, a process that seems to involve endless displacement activity, and I find that if I switch The Bill on at 9am on UK Gold, I am all too likely to be still watching hours later as the schedule swings its way through hospital emergency rooms and Australian soaps that would have sent me screaming from the room when they were first screened but that now exert a compelling 'must see what happens next' force on me. If you watch too much daytime television, you soon become aware that the commercials in the advertising breaks are aimed very much at people who, to say the least, are likely to have trouble with their finances. There are ads for personal-injury lawyers encouraging various mugwumps to try and claim compo for 'accidents' that they've supposedly had. There are loads of companies offering loans, encouraging other mugwumps to borrow huge sums of money to buy essential items like conservatory extensions for their 10th-floor council flats or their own rocket or trampoline lessons for their cat. Another type of ad aimed at the financially challenged is for firms with names such as Yes, Car Credit, which offer to provide newish cars for people who absolutely nobody else will sell cars to (and, let's face it, car salesmen are not really that choosy); there's one interesting feature of these particular commercials - all the blokes in them have big fat wives; I guess that they know their market and the only fantasy aspect is connected with the cars. And finally in every break there are several adverts from companies with names such as Baines & Ernst that offer to combine all the debts that you've acquired from making stupid purchases, paying way too much for a T-reg Vauxhall Astra and trying to sue gravity for making you fall over, into one single loan that you owe them rather than your several hundred creditors. However, an interesting sideline that these companies provide is that they also offer to combine all your moral debts into one big moral debt that you owe them. So now I have to drive Baines and Ernst to the airport every week, I have to clean their carpet and I must never ever look at another woman except Baines and Ernst. I also have to apologise to them for stopping this column for a while. While doing press promotion for my new collection of short stories, which was released in August, I would tell journalists interviewing me that, with my first collection of stories, Barcelona Plates, selling over 50,000 copies and this new one, The Dog Catcher, doing over 15,000 in hardback in six weeks, I was the most successful short-story writer in Britain since the war. Now, amazingly, it turns out that this might actually be true! I never expected that. Of course, the fact is that these numbers that I have been bragging about would be considered totally piddling in any other field of the media that I've been involved in, but in publishing these numbers denote a major smash hit, partly because very few people buy collections of short stories. I think I have finally found the artistic field that I should be in, a field where tiny numbers still denote huge success, where the minuscule number of twisted, supercilious malcontents who find me funny can make a gigantic difference to the percentages of sales figures. Once I might have sneered at this, but my sense now, which has been arrived at over years of an up-and-down showbusiness career, is that success is success, and whatever denotes success makes you feel much better and if you are feeling good about yourself that feeling is reflected in numerous ways. I remember years ago that I visited a restaurant in Covent Garden with Lenny Henry. We had just done a TV show together called OTT which had caused a big furore and had been a disaster so big that I'd returned from Birmingham where the show was made with somebody else's tail between my legs. This restaurant we went to made a big deal of its visitors' book, which they nagged me into signing. A few years later I happened to revisit this place at a time when I had my own hit television series and was feeling on top of the world with a string of awards and massive viewing figures. Flipping back through the pages of the restaurant's visitors' book, I was able to compare my signatures, then and now. Looking back at the first it was tiny, crabbed, tentative and spidery reflecting my feeble doubting inner state, while my second autograph was bold and flowing, taking up half a page, obviously full of confidence and self-belief. Also, for some reason, on my first visit to the restaurant I had been calling myself 'Les Dennis'. I don't know why. Anyway, because I am such a big hit as an author, I will be leaving this column for a while to try and write that Booker-losing novel. I think it's a good time to leave newspaper writing for a while, it's not like there's anything much going on in the world to write about. Sometimes, you really have to scratch your head a bit. The economic data have signalled generally upbeat news. Industrial surveys are consistently pointing to recovery, even if actual growth in the second half of 2001 was rather disappointing. Yet the financial markets remain very sceptical, with equities lower relative to the end of last year. Meanwhile, Messrs Greenspan and George are prepared only to be cautiously optimistic. Yes, the worst may now be behind us. But, no, there can be no guarantees of a rapid return to buoyant - and, perhaps, more importantly - sustainable economic growth. What should we make of these cross currents? There are one or two reasonably straightforward conclusions. First, it's pretty clear, even with a recovery, there is no immediate risk of a return to higher interest rates. If there are doubts about the sustainability of economic growth, it would be a bit odd to take the risk of raising interest rates only to be blamed for creating a subsequent 'double-dip'. Knee-jerk financial market reactions that point to higher interest rates at the first sign of recovery should, therefore, be dismissed. Second, if the recovery is ultimately constrained, the inflationary outlook should be subdued for a prolonged period of time. Indeed, to the extent that activity levels remain below where they should be - either because unemployment is too high or because there's plenty of spare capacity - there's a good chance that inflation may undershoot central bank targets. This leads to some interesting results. At the Bank of England, for example, the corridors are still echoing more to the sound of cooing doves than screeching hawks. Underneath all of this, however, is an issue about recession and recovery. If the recession is shallow, what does this say about the subsequent recovery? This is a key question for policy makers today. The downswing through the course of 2001 proved to be relatively mild. Indeed, as Alan Greenspan said in his testimony before Congress last week, 'the recuperative powers of the US economy ... have been remarkable'. Clearly, Mr Greenspan is hopeful that the worst is now over and, certainly from a data perspective, there has been plenty of good news recently. Yet he is never one to have his cake and eat it. Although the economy did not perform as badly as feared in the second half of last year, the US Federal Reserve chairman was quick to emphasise that 'an array of influences unique to this business cycle ... seems likely to moderate the speed of the anticipated recovery'. Of course, these words simply emphasise that Mr Greenspan is a master of the 'on the one hand, on the other hand' approach beloved of so many economists. Nevertheless, he has good reasons to remain concerned about the medium-term outlook, irrespective of the recent signs of economic improvement. Here's a little story for you. A country has just been through a prolonged boom in economic activity. Asset prices have risen rapidly, far outstripping gains in indebtedness, either for consumers or for companies. The asset price bubble eventually bursts. There are fears of a collapse in economic activity yet, initially, these fears prove to be unfounded. Certainly, growth slows down but, unlike other countries, there is no significant contraction in economic activity. Indeed, on the so-called 'technical definition' (two successive quarters of declining GDP), recession is avoided. Meanwhile, although asset prices come down sharply, consumers continue to spend rather than save. Now, you're probably thinking that this is the US story over the past year or so - and, of course, you'd be absolutely right. Consumers have carried on spending. The economy has held up better than expected, continuing to outperform the likes of Germany and Japan (and, for that matter, the UK in the final quarter of last year). And the dollar has remained strong, suggesting an international vote of confidence in all things American. Unfortunately, however, exactly the same observations could have been made about Japan at the beginning of the 1990s. The Japanese bubble burst at the end of 1989. Equity prices began their relentless decline, followed by land prices a year and a half later. The initial weakness in asset prices didn't seem to do too much damage. True, the economy began to slow down relative to the stellar performance seen at the end of the 1980s. However, relative to the performance of other countries, Japan continued to do well. In 1990, Japan saw 5.3 per cent growth compared with 1.8 per cent in the US and 0.8 per cent in the UK. In 1991, growth in Japan slowed to 3.1 per cent but, in the same year, GDP fell 0.5 per cent in the US and by 1.4 per cent in the UK. Meanwhile, the yen began a steady appreciation. I would not want to suggest that the US is about to go down Japan's path. There are lots of differences - in economic structure, in the desire for profit, in the flexibility of the workforce, in the pace of productivity growth. These imply that America is a lot better placed to deal with the consequences of a sustained decline in asset prices. Nevertheless, Japan's experience does suggest that we should be careful in concluding too much from the initial stages of a decline in asset prices. The US may still be outperforming the rest of the world for the time being. But can we really be sure that this story will continue in the years ahead? This question boils down to an issue about imbalances, factors that might constrain the ability of an economy to grow over the medium term. One way to think about this is to regard recession as unpleasant cleansing experiences - a bit like taking a cold shower with a lump of carbolic soap. The process might not be very pleasant but at least you come out more hygienic, if not smelling of roses. Has the US been through this cleansing experience? To date, the answer is probably 'no'. The current account deficit is large and is likely to increase even further in the short term if the economy continues to rebound. Consumers have yet to increase their savings even with a major decline in asset values. Profits have seen the biggest decline in the post-war period and, to date, have shown no transparent signs of a rebound (indeed, transparency and profits have not exactly been obvious bedfellows recently). Basically, we are not out of the woods yet. If anything, financial market indicators are pointing to more signs of distress. Risky assets, like equities, have fallen in value relative to 'safer' investments like government bonds and cash. Banks continue to limit lending to the corporate sector. The commercial paper market has dried up. These factors all suggest that the current recovery may fade later in the year. The Fed's shot in the arm last year may have given the US economy enough strength for a short sprint forward but America's reputation as a long- distance runner may be fading. Pain de campagne, sourdoughs, baguettes, ciabatta and exotic loaves incorporating everything from carrot to olives, spinach to sun-dried tomato. The supermarkets' bakery shelves are chock-a-block, and judging by the mind-boggling variety on offer, real bread seems to be enjoying a massive revival in Britain. But has good, traditionally made bread really made a comeback? The suggestion prompts Tom Jaine, former editor of the Good Food Guide and author of Making Bread At Home (Cassell, œ9.99), to froth like over-yeasted dough. 'Most of the bread that masquerades as real isn't real at all. In a tiny way, it is different from the supermarket bread of 10 years ago, but it's no better. I've just eaten a sunflower-seed loaf from Duchy Originals that was every bit as nasty as mass-produced bread. Supermarket sourdoughs made ostensibly with natural leavens are as insubstantial and characterless as the ones they used to make with yeast.' Jaine insists that 'the move to real bread is actually restricted to a minute proportion of the London middle class'. Certainly, a fine crop of good bread shops has appeared in the capital in the past few years, mainly in the posher postal districts. The haute couture pinnacle of real bread is represented by Poilƒne. The signature bread produced from the wood-fired stoves of its Belgravia bakery (the only Poilƒne outlet outside Paris) is a tremendous sourdough loaf of close texture and wonderful, complex flavour. This bread is famously the favourite crust of de Niro, Bacall and Deneuve - but don't let that put you off, or the fact that a loaf costs around œ6. Weighing the best part of 2kg, it will last most families for a week or more. Another welcome French newcomer is the Paul bakery in Covent Garden, the first English branch of a chain with 250 outlets in France. The Baker & Spice bakery in South Kensington produces equally superb bread, which can also be bought at branches of Konditor & Cook. If you see their San Francisco sourdough or potato-and- rosemary bread, snap it up before someone else does. The three branches of de Gustibus sell 20 fine breads. Black Forest rye and roasted onion rye are particularly worth seeking out. London's latest and coolest are the two Exeter Street Bakery shops in Kensington and Covent Garden selling Italian breads and pizzas perfected by the restaurateur who brought Joe Allen over here. Then there's the 10 branches of Maison Blanc... But where does this leave real- bread addicts who live outside London? Sainsbury's claims to be making the right stuff. As part of its Taste the Difference range, two-thirds of Sainsbury's 300 stores now stock a range of speciality breads. Not a bad effort, you think at first. The French Country Loaf certainly looks the part, but the crust was too thin and the crumb was too open-textured. Worse still, it was so salty that we ended up throwing it out. Sainsbury's raisin-and-rosemary loaf is vast for œ1.99, but the raisins proved to be few and far between. A seed-and-honey loaf was OK for toasting. One grain of comfort for non-metropolitan loaf-lovers is mail order. The Village Bakery will ship from its Cumbrian ovens any order for a flat rate of œ4.95. You can choose from 17 breads, all baked in a wood- fired oven, including a natural-leaven campagne and a Russian sourdough called Rossisky.
Now the BBC has embraced 'narrowcasting' with its new channels, Boyd Tonkin asks if TV will ever again surprise us with the unexpected. On Saturday, the BBC's new cultural channel finally shed the dowdy chrysalis of Knowledge to emerge as a gaudy butterfly known as 'Four'. Not all of us can stick around to watch the metamorphosis. After a first night of joint transmission with BBC 2, Four's six hours per day of arts, ideas and reportage has reverted to the digital platforms still closed to the half of British households who can only receive terrestrial fare. Roly Keating, the corporation's doyen of arts who became Four's first controller in the new year, will be hoping to make his mark in a blaze of light glory. For the BBC, a lot rides on the reception of Four. Greg Dyke and his satraps gaze nervously towards the expiry of their current Charter in 2006. The long-planned national switch-over from analogue to digital television sets proceeds at more of a crawl than a gallop. To put it bluntly, Four not only has to recruit a loyal core of arts addicts and documentary demons; it must also help to persuade opinion-shifters in politics and the media that the BBC licence fee remains the only defensible form of poll-tax in 700 years of British history. Four has won over Downing Street without too much of a battle. The Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell green-lighted it last autumn, along with the BBC's two digital children's channels. However, backstage ructions from commercial competitors have delayed approval for the corporation's revamped youth service, BBC Three. It's no secret that the Beeb's rivals - above all, Rupert Murdoch - keenly resent the spectacle of licence-funded empire-building a dozen years after the advent of Sky - it seems to presage the secular decline of public-service broadcasting. With a clever touch of bathos, Four slid down the slipway at the weekend not with some operatic blockbuster but a Dadaist squib: a film about the artist Michael Landy, who trashed his 7,000 possessions in the window of a defunct West End store. It bore the title The Man who Destroyed Everything. As far as the BBC goes, Rupert Murdoch would wish for no other epitaph. The details of Four so far announced show why he should never get his way. To be sure, some merely fill the glaring holes left by the makeover of BBC 2 into a cookery-and-comedy location for 35-year-olds: a weekly books programme, The Readers and Writers Roadshow, for instance, or the reliably left-field Storyville documentary strand, and an 8pm news slot with a global remit. Other promised delights keep up the grand tradition of 'gala television': Peter Brook's Hamlet from Paris; Romanian diva Angela Gheorghiu in concert; or the Africa Now music festival staged in a soccer stadium in Senegal. Yet we already have Artsworld and Performance channels to do the first-night folderol. Behind the handsome limbs, Four hopes to offer a skeleton of inquiry and debate in features such as the ideas-driven Talk Show with Andrew Marr. Let's hope that such regular articulations allow the channel to act more like a coherent creature than a Frankenstein's monster of scavenged art-parts. As it happens, Mary Shelley's stroke of inspiration on the shores of Lake Geneva has loomed large in the publicity for Four. Frequent trailers have deployed the notion of the genius loci to label the new outfit as 'a place to think'. All the hype agrees that this must be a special location, 'satisfyingly different' from mainstream TV - a haven for seekers and mavericks. Now, who (apart from Mr Murdoch) could possibly object to that? Well, you can welcome the channel's content while still lamenting the drift towards segmentation and fragmentation that its coming represents. These days, we are all the playthings of demography, our tastes ticketed and bracketed by media puppet-masters who long to give us exactly what they know we want - and nothing less, or more. 'Niche' culture permits providers to deliver targeted audiences to advertisers with enough exactitude to make sure that a twentysomething urban clubber seldom has to contemplate an ad for a DIY greenhouse or a stair-lift. Filterers and packagers devote their time and skill to guaranteeing that we never run across any item that surprises or intrigues us. If it didn't sound too much like the sort of pompous Restoration tragedy that not even Four would deign to broadcast, you might call this trend the Death of Serendipity. Of course, the BBC has no fickle advertisers to please (just fickle politicians). So it doesn't need to play the demographic game of divide-and-lure in quite so crude a fashion. The chief constituency of Four ought to consist of self-selecting minorities convened by a passion - whether for qawwali music or quantum theory - rather than by the brute parameters of region, age or class. Always remember that a large majority of affluent folk take their leisure in entirely populist forms: last week, we learned that a third of Chelsea ticket-holders earn more than œ50,000 per year. Meanwhile, Keating and colleagues vow that BBC 2 in particular will not treat the birth of Four as a pretext for an even deeper plunge into gardening-and-game-show territory. We shall see. In 'narrowcasting' ventures such as Four, there's a paradox at work that deserves more attention than it gets. Since the Sixties, many of the most exciting pulses of innovation across a spread of cultural forms have come from a push towards fusion and hybridity. Creatively confused artists have sought to abolish the distance between ‚lite and popular styles, 'highbrow' and 'lowbrow' registers, learned and vernacular traditions. Look at some of BBC Four's early performance slots, and you'll spot this force in progress: Bj”rk sings at Covent Garden; Fidelio comes live from a Birmingham big top; an opera company mounts a (successful) search for new divas in the townships of South Africa. Tune in to the liveliest American TV (so often the benchmark for canny British broadcasters), and this pattern stares you in the face. Buffy the Vampire Slayer samples 300 years of Gothic visual and literary style, and places a self-conscious embodiment of European high culture (Giles) at its heart; Seinfeld stages his deadpan, free-form postmodern jests; The Simpsons import the dynamics of Eugene O'Neill and Arthur Miller into the animated comic-strip. Yet, while makers of culture everywhere cross boundaries and blur distinctions, its marketers labour to reinforce them. Audiences are sliced and sorted into ever thinner bands. With the birth of CBeebies, even the under-fives have their own channel. Internet-providers track your path through the web in order to deliver the sites your record shows (or seems to show) you want. Newspapers dream of delivering the online 'Daily Me', pre-edited according to your preferences. A smart box called the TiVo will not merely record favourite TV shows but, when it knows you well enough, anticipate your viewing choice as well. Even in the reliably behind-the-beat book trade, publishers and retailers flog their wares under the unvarying rubric, 'If you liked X, you'll love Y'. But my haphazard education in the arts (like millions of others') came about because I stumbled without signposts across 'Z' and decided I should spend more time in that place. Serendipity - the book picked up by accident, the film at first watched reluctantly, the magical snatch of music overheard - can shape the lifelong experience of those blessed with such happy accidents. For a brief period, so one broadcasting fable goes, the single-channel BBC TV embodied this ideal of diversity-in-unity. Plenty of veterans recall it as history, while many younger programme-makers dismiss it as pure myth. One evening sometime in the early Sixties, according to this story, the loyal BBC-watcher might have grazed through an arts magazine, some serious current affairs, a gritty commissioned drama, half an hour of classic Tony Hancock comedy, a satirical blast of That was the Week that Was, and (if they were especially lucky) the sight of A J P Taylor explaining the origins of the Great War with only a bow-tie for special effects. Today's brash moguls of Reality TV (notably, Peter Bazalgette) mock this memory as a nostalgic fabrication. They point out, with some justice, that BBC TV in its 'Golden Age' was where the decrepit remnants of British music-hall went to die, in agony - for the viewers. Yet, as William Blake wrote, 'A truth that's told with bad intent/ Beats all the lies you can invent'. The Bazalgettes grow fat on fragmentation. They don't want to see a truly varied TV schedule in operation again. So they deny that it ever existed. In their perspective, only the Big Brothers, Weakest Links and Pop Idols can be allowed the prime-time honour of shaping the national chat. How soon before Will Young looks old? On the other hand, Puccini and Pavarotti still live in the affections of millions because some inspired producer trampled the barriers and decided to fanfare Italia 90 with 'Nessun Dorma'. Serendipity needs a little shove, at times. And the BBC brass need to recall that one of their real triumphs in the past decade has been a bits-and-bobs radio station that flourished despite - or, perhaps, because of - a higgledy-piggledy brief: Five Live. What will the BBC team choose for this summer's transmissions from Japan and South Korea? Madame Butterfly might sound a trifle too corny. Still, some of us can hope that, one fine day, a television vessel freighted with a richly varied cargo will sail back into the harbour of our lives. Motorists who have just passed their driving test may be subject to tougher drink-drive and speeding laws under plans being considered by the Government. Lower blood-alcohol levels and reduced speed limits were two of 18 possible options in a consultation paper about novice drivers published yesterday. Other options for new drivers include restrictions on night-time driving, making them drive smaller-engined vehicles, and the compulsory display of 'P' - provisional - plates for six or 12 months after passing the test. Compulsory professional tuition for learners and accompanying drivers, skid and motorway training, and the introduction of a probationary licence code for the first two years are also being considered. Andrew Howard, the AA's head of road safety policy, welcomed the paper but added: 'Some of the suggestions in the consultation paper are impractical and unenforceable.' The AA believes the introduction of P plates would do little to improve safety and it warns that limiting the time when young drivers may drive is likely to be impractical. So long, bricks and mortar. Cheaper, greener options are available. Little boxes made of ticky tacky... it may have been a good refrain and a fair indictment of a nation's love of bricks and mortar, but today's house builders are challenging the stereotype by using more inventive materials and building methods at both ends of the eco spectrum. Bellway Homes is nearing completion on The Hamsterley, a Georgian-style polystyrene kit house which John Watson, their chief executive, describes as 'a glamorous prefab that is here to stay'. He adds: 'We like to explore new technologies. This is a potential revolution in British housing and in building this house, the first of its kind in the country, we are demonstrating the possibilities from this unique design through to delivery.' The five-bedroom property is the first traditional- look, factory-built sectional house made of polystyrene and steel for sale in the UK. Its lightweight steel frame, clad externally with light but extremely strong insulating panels, makes it highly energy-efficient. The polystyrene house may have an SAP (standard assessment procedures) rating of 100 per cent, but some builders prefer greener materials. Richard Scales and Ralph Carpenter of Modece Architects worked on a hemp house in Haverhill, Suffolk and have mixed views on the use of polystyrene. Mr Scales says: 'There are some benefits, because it's energy efficient, but it's not green. It's using material derived from oil, which is unsustainable because fossil fuel will one day run out.' The material used to create the hemp house will never run out if the project takes off. Ralph Carpenter's inspiration came from a visit to France, where he first saw hemp being used in construction. He convinced Suffolk Housing Society and St Edmundsbury council to lead a trial to discover whether hemp is a suitable building material. The hemp houses have been built beside traditional brick-and-block constructions, and insulation, soundproofing, structural ability, resistance to moisture and condensation will be monitored to make comparisons. Encouragingly for architects such as Mr Scales, large-scale developers are interested in the hemp house, but he accepts the use of greener materials on a mass scale may take time. 'Most of the industry is locked into bricks and blocks, because that's the way their operatives are used to working and understand. If you start using different materials then that jacks the price up as they can't do it without thinking, which seems to cost more.' Ultimately the hemp project may revive a crop that used to be grown extensively in Britain, but it should be pointed out that, unlike its notorious cousin, hemp used in construction has no hallucinatory qualities. Steve Clarke, Suffolk Housing Society's chief executive, says: 'We are hoping that it will make a significant contribution to finding a more environmentally friendly way to create new homes.' At present, innovative building projects inevitably cost more than traditional methods, but this may change. Initially the hemp house was considered expensive, although it may prove cheaper in the long term. One building in north London has proved it is possible to produce a cost-effective construction that is also sustainable. Number 9 Stock Orchard Street, designed by Sarah Wigglesworth Architects, is partly built with straw bales. Architects Sarah Wigglesworth and Jeremy Till, who live and work in the house, say: 'The building pays attention, as we believe every building should, to issues of environment. Materials are chosen for their low embodied energy: straw bales, recycled concrete and sandbags.' The straw-bale house is a good example of research by design in a project featuring the first approved use of this material in the UK, although there is a growing straw-bale movement in the US, and its benefits are many. Straw costs œ1.50p per bale delivered to central London, is widely available, easy to build with and provides good thermal insulation because it 'breathes'. The architects installed the bales with friends and family. Standard practice is to render the bales on both sides, but here the architects have clad the building on the outside with a rain screen. Having ensured the walls are carefully detailed to keep out vermin and water - 'both things that would otherwise lead to a short life', they add. 'The tension between the roughness of the bales and the sleek exterior of the cling-film sheathing disturbs the normal architectural categories, uniting the slick with the hairy.'
You don't actually need computers for special effects, as the Bafta Award ceremony demonstrated on Sunday evening. As the stars arrived, an unforeseen combination of household chemicals and the worst of English weather added a mildly uncanny detail to the clich‚s of photographer's flashes and red carpet. A sebaceous slime appeared beneath the feet of the celebrities, a copious froth which seemed like a manifestation of some otherwise intangible presence, a kind of miasma of ego, perhaps. I can't have been alone, though, in thinking how much more powerful the scene would have been with a bit of post-production CGI work. You can easily imagine a Stephen King rationale. A red carpet haunted by the spirit of a murdered extra decides that it isn't going to let the stars walk all over it anymore - and as the more pernicious characters beam and smirk their way into the ceremony a malevolent ectoplasm swirls towards them across the surface, oozing upwards over the Manolo Blahniks and Versace dresses to vandalise their glamour. The effect might even win an award - given the current popularity of this kind of visual excess. Certainly the lavish digital effects in Lord of the Rings can't have done that film any harm when it came to handing out the prizes, since without computer-generated imagery - or GGI for short - it would barely have been conceivable as a project. Altogether there were something like 500 special-effect shots in Lord of the Rings, overlapped so that it was often impossible to tell where real objects stopped and the purely virtual ones began. . There are purists who find this depressing - an indication that the long cinematic stand-off between the LumiŠre school (dedicated to the ethical superiority of unmediated photography) and the followers of M‚liŠs (equally passionate about film's ability to play with time and space like putty) has finally been settled in favour of fantasy. For such people, digital effects are the cinematic equivalent of genetically modified foods, and the only way for them to guarantee the purity of their diet these days is to go comprehensively organic, refusing to consume anything unless it has come from markets too poor to afford technological adulteration. Anything from Mali or Iran can usually be counted as safe. In one respect the Cassandras are right. The intermingling of real and computer generated is now so sophisticated that it descends to the level of individual particles. In the film Pearl Harbor, for example, real smoke and its computer-generated equivalent were often used in combination to achieve the required effect. Elsewhere computer effects are preferred to the real thing because of their biddability. In Black Hawk Down there was no difficulty in achieving the dust clouds caused by helicopter rotor wash, but it tended to inconvenience the actors, so the ground was dampened before filming and the 'real' effect added later. The result, of course, was realism - which from the very beginning of cinema has always been a highly artificial substance. But when it comes to the suggestion that CGI may be fundamentally toxic to the cinematic enterprise, its enemies are on weaker ground. True, it is currently an overused technology, prone to distract its devotees from humble virtues such as narrative coherence and psychological plausibility. Reviewing Vidocq - the first film to be made entirely with digital cameras - the Hollywood Reporter offered what has become a fairly familiar coupling. It was, it declared, 'visually stunning and stunningly inane', a judgement which you might do well to keep on hand for the release of the next Star Wars movie - shot on digital cameras in three months, followed by 18 months of post-production digital tweaking. But this needn't mean the death of art. Quite the opposite. Predictions that sound would destroy cinema, and then that colour would fatally weaken its constitution, eventually proved exaggerated. All those innovations needed was artists who could use them properly. And even now there are signs that the most high-minded directors are intrigued by the ability of computers to blur the distinction between our visual and emotional perceptions, to let them write with light. In The Lady and the Duke, the veteran director Eric Rohmer used CGI to set his historical drama against pastiches of period painting and printmaking, rather than a conventional reconstruction. Instead of painting out anachronism, he used the technology to paint in period. Others will come who will make even subtler use of the opportunity to align what they see in their heads with what we all eventually see on the screen. We are in at the birth, in fact, of the most intensively manipulated cinema we've ever known - and that manipulation will not always be bent solely on making teenagers moan 'awesome'. The battle is already lost, but in the end there may be no losers. It would be a pity if celebrations of the Queen's golden jubilee became confused with the debate about the future of the monarchy. The one looks back in gratitude, the other contemplates the serious issue of how the next head of state and those thereafter should be chosen. In our private lives we try to avoid muddling up the two things. We don't say thank you to somebody for a job well done over many years and at the very same ceremony, so to speak, when the presentations are made and the speeches given, loudly discuss whether it couldn't all be done better in the future. We leave that for another day. Let us cast our minds back 50 years. On 6 February 1952, King George VI died in his sleep. His valet discovered the body at 7.30am. It was nearly noon in London before the news could be given to his eldest daughter, Elizabeth, who was thousands of miles away in Kenya. She had taken the King's place on a Commonwealth tour. A courtier saw her as she was preparing to return to London. She was sitting erect, no tears, colour up a little, fully accepting what lay ahead. The new Queen was 25 years old. For the first 11 years of her life, that is until the abdication of her uncle, King Edward VIII, neither she nor her father had expected that they would, in turn, ascend to the throne. It was the last thing that her father, who loved a quiet family life and had a disabling stammer, wanted to happen. He was initially terrified. But the Queen's father didn't turn away like his brother. He did his duty. The Queen has followed this example. This aspect of the Queen's upbringing and character needs to be taken into account if the many assessments that will be made of her during this golden jubilee year are to be fair. In the hereditary system the task falls to you. Your only choice is whether to do it conscientiously or not. Even to do it to the best of your ability, unremittingly, for 50 long years and more? Yes, if that is how it turns out. When her father was king, Elizabeth used to look through the windows of Buckingham Palace at the people and cars in the Mall wondering what they were doing, where they were going, what they were thinking. Nobody else has had such a life, with its isolation, with its ceaseless pressure, with its stern requirements. When still only 21 she made a famous public vow in a broadcast during a visit to South Africa: 'I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.' Substitute 'Commonwealth' for 'imperial', and it can be see that she has fully kept her promise. Now I say that for doing a difficult, arduous job for half a century, the Queen deserves heartfelt thanks. On this point, it is irrelevant whether one is a monarchist or a republican. Indeed, the monarchical system is the more unforgiving. We watch and we criticise whomever the hereditary principle places, willing or unwilling, capable or incapable, on the throne. Many years ago the Queen told her riding master that had she not been who she was, she would like to have been a lady living in the country with lots of horses and dogs. How should the nation's thanks be expressed? Many local authorities remain reluctant to organise or finance celebrations. They are waiting, I think, to read the public mood. This hasn't yet formed. But it will become clear. At the last jubilee, 25 years ago, the result was that a large number of spontaneously organised street parties took place all over the country. On the death of Princess Diana, a completely different feeling quickly manifested itself. It was grief-stricken, but also cross with the royal family for its cool response. The golden jubilee mood will be, I think, warm, grateful and respectful. Street parties may well seem inappropriate this time. That doesn't matter. For the plans already in place are quite sufficient for the occasion. Starting with Cornwall on 1 May, the Queen is making a series of visits to all parts of the United Kingdom. She finishes in Lancashire on 5 August. In the middle of this period will be a concentrated four days of festivities. On 1 June and 4 June respectively, free classical and a pop concerts will be held in the gardens of Buckingham Palace, on 2 June jubilee churches services and bell ringing will take place across the country and the next day a procession with the gold state coach will go to St Paul's Cathedral for a thanksgiving service, followed by lunch at the Guildhall. In 1960, the Queen asked President de Gaulle, who had come on a state visit, what he thought her role should be. He perfectly understood: 'In the station to which God has called you, be who you are Madam, that is to say the person in whom your people perceive its own nationhood, and by whose presence and dignity that national unity is upheld.' Presence and dignity. Those she has provided. Even in these days of trans-Channel Europhoria, our European allies are still some way away from agreeing a joint foreign or social, let alone education policy. So it was quite a feat for the London ambassadors of four major European nations to co-ordinate a joint message to the government and people of Britain, regretting the 'sad' state of language teaching in this country. Their complaint - that British schools are so uninterested in languages that European schools find it hard to arrange school exchanges - was nicely timed to catch the latest instalment of our continuing national debate about linguistic competence, which is conducted under the working title: 'Why are we so awful at languages?' With all due deference to Their Excellencies, and considerable trepidation, I would venture another view about the British and their linguistic abilities, and I do so from the rare - but thankfully not yet unique - position of being, by training, a British linguist. Contrary to common belief, here and abroad, a British linguist is not a contradiction in terms. This country does produce a respectable crop of graduate linguists. Most leave university thoroughly competent in one, more often two, foreign languages. Their university course will have included a spell abroad, perhaps as long as a year. Many of these graduates will also have studied two or three foreign languages at school, one or more to A-level. The armed forces and the diplomatic service train their own staff in so-called 'hard languages', such as Arabic or Japanese, as and when they need them. These diverse routes to language acquisition may not be the most efficient use of resources, but they yield results. British linguists are among the best in the world. When we put our minds to learning languages, we learn them systematically and well. I defy anyone to say that a native English speaker has a worse ear for languages than a native French, German, Italian or Spanish speaker. Where we are genuinely deficient is in making every pupil proficient in at least one foreign language. And here motivation is a large part of the problem. It is not only practical and necessary for most foreigners to be able to speak English, it is also - and at school this is crucial - fashionable. However routine and boring English lessons at schools in France and Germany may be, many pupils will go home and listen to CDs or surf the internet in English. London hardly needed the now abandoned Cool Britannia campaign to attract young Europeans. It is seen - even in Paris, Madrid and Rome - as the youth capital of Europe. That is not the only reason for the one-sidedness of applications for school exchanges. English is the first foreign language in most European schools. Even if all British children learning French took part in an exchange to a French school and vice versa, there would still be the German, Italian, Spanish, Austrian, Dutch, and Belgian schools that would want an exchange with a British school. There are simply not enough British schools or pupils to be exchanged. Many young Britons are making quite a rational decision when they neglect their language classes - a decision that has little to do with the quality of the tuition. There are many things that they will need in later life, but right now, with all the other demands of the national curriculum, language- learning seems more of a luxury than a necessity. The first task for schools must be to convince young Britons that a foreign language is, if not necessary, then at least desirable. Starting a first foreign language much earlier - seven is being suggested - would at least convey that it is a 'basic' rather than a supplement. British reserve and adolescent shyness also make 11 arguably the worst time to start learning a foreign language in a big class. Despite the howls from many of my fellow linguists, I also tend to support the Education Secretary, Estelle Morris, in allowing 14-year-olds to abandon their foreign language. If they have no interest or are not making progress by then, it is a waste of everyone's time and money for them to continue. The corollary, though, should be not just the earlier start to language-learning, but the provision of more opportunities, in the form of subsidised non-school courses, later in life, when need, inclination and interest might all coincide. To that end, universities and colleges should be encouraged to open up their language training facilities to as wide a participation as possible. The combination that I took at school - Classics, German and Russian - is now even less available in schools than it was then, despite the promise that big comprehensives would make 'minority' subjects more viable. In the future, it will probably still be the few - those whose interest is tweaked by travel, foreign friends or a sympathy for language - who form the next generation of 'British linguists', but let's give far more people a chance. Every year, each student will spend at least œ4,500 on living costs, such as rent, travel and food. On top of that will be tuition costs, averaging around œ3,000 over the study period. Research shows that an average student will expect to owe around œ7,000 by the time they have completed their university studies.
She was the best-selling queen of the romantic Aga saga. He was the enfant terrible of the right-on urban literati. Would the earth move when their paths crossed? I quite like Joanna Trollope; she's warm, engaged and responsive, and clearly has her heart in approximately the right place. To me, she is a quintessentially English phenomenon, the lower-middlebrow novelist who has just enough sophistication to be able to convince her readership that they may be getting an upper-middlebrow product. She's also quite vulnerable, Joanna, and has had quite a monstering from the Daily Mail, that paper bastion of Agashire, which is, of course, her proper province. In an interview in another newspaper last week, Joanna seemingly admitted to leading a rather unseemly life nowadays, cruising the London streets on the lookout for thirtysomething men to have uncommitted sex with. She also posed for a photographer, exhibiting her long, slim legs clad in fishnet stockings. Predictably, the envious wrath of middle-aged Middle England descended on her, this scion of the sleeveless anorak and the Liberty headscarf. 'I was miserable, and I then had stringers from the Daily Mail all over my patch in the country, my mother... everyone you can think of, trying to get people to rubbish me. And you do then feel like a cornered animal... I'm just so conscious a lot of the time that it's horrible for my children, having a well-known mother; it's beastly having a parent in the public eye.' I observe to Joanna that it's really quite vulgar, being famous, and she concedes that it is. She says that she continues to publicise her books quite as much as she does because she's 'always waiting to go out of fashion, because with every book I think this will be it... and I suppose I've had a sort of superstition about prolonging that moment', but that 'after last week I'm asking myself very seriously why.' She says that the remarks about sex she made were general, rather than specific to her, and were quite misrepresented. Anyway, she said those things only after courteously answering a long string of sexual enquiries. I believe her in all this. Joanna doesn't want to make a fuss, although when I ask if she'd like me to outline the dispute as I have above, she says: 'That would be excellent, Will.' Joanna uses my first name quite a lot when we talk, and I think this is partly sincere and partly political. She's quite attractive and looks - as many have observed - young for her 58 years. However, not absurdly, Dorian Gray-ishly so; she's no Marie Helvin. I think the brouhaha that surrounds poor youthful Joanna has as much to do with her rotten old borough of a constituency as it does with anything intrinsic to her. Sitting on the other side of a boring coffee table, in the dull matutinal hinterland of the Soho members' club in which we meet for an hour on a rainy weekday, she looks sleek in flared leather trousers, a hip-length woollen jacket with a leather collar, and silver jewellery (Boadicea shield-boss earrings, thin, multi-stranded bracelet). She looks, in fact, like what she is: a million- selling lady novelist of a certain age. The trouble is that on the evidence of her conversation, that age is about 33 rather than 58, and quite a young 33 at that. There's this business of the 'Will's to begin with - when I tell her that both my parents are dead (hers are alive), her emotion swells and prolapses all over the table: 'Oh, Will, I am so sorry!', although she then qualifies this by conceding that it's my children and my parents that she's sorry for. The Daily Mail feels that Joanna has reinvented herself as a leggy sex siren in order to flog more books, particularly as her latest, Girl from the South, features 30-year-old protagonists and is set in the distinctly racy environs of Parsons Green. But Joanna says: 'If I was once seen as a provincial housewife in a Laura Ashley cardie under an apple tree with Labradors - which was also a misrepresentation - the life I'm living now does not lack its own integrity; it is not a false fa‡ade. There's a sort of abiding irritation about being assumed somehow not to be true to yourself.' Well, indeed, and I don't think for a minute Joanna has self-consciously and manipulatively created a new public image to sell books. No, I think she's distinctly immature and, despite 10 years of media exposure, she doesn't quite understand that press interviews are not the place to discuss your jejune self-image problems. Joanna's had quite a bad time. Her second marriage, of 18 years, ended in divorce three years ago, and she had quite a severe breakdown that left her virtually incommunicado for a further year. Now, she's living in west London (she won't be more specific, as she savours her newfound metropolitan anonymity), attending cultural events galore, dating and - of course - writing more stories. I think Joanna's quite modest, but not as modest as she would like to be. To me she says of her books: 'I think they're good, with distinct weaknesses, and sometimes I think I have a flash of insight. But there's a huge difference between being good and being great. It's very difficult to know, isn't it, looking at our contemporaries, who will emerge as great. Y'know, I think the odd John Fowles will. Penelope Fitzgerald I think will, but I'm under absolutely no illusion about where I fit in. I'm right for these times; I've got a kind of acuteness about contemporary relationships that's right for now, but it's not going to be right for ever.' Discounting the oddity of finding myself bracketed with her as a contemporary of J Fowles (b1926) and P Fitzgerald (b1916) - which rather stretches the notion of contemporaneity beyond the bounds of my sense - I find this 'umble dismissal of her craft by Joanna as being mere 'acuity' quite difficult to take, as the only other writer she ascribes it to is the one she insists on calling 'the real Trollope'. No, Joanna has that affectation of the successful of appearing to be dismissive of her own standing, while clearly believing that the important voting is done by the feet of a thousand thousand readers. 'I read every review, and the bad ones, if written by someone I admire, I take really to heart; I mean I think we can all profit from them. But the people I have the greatest faith in are the readers. They are amazing; they're the ones that have contributed to professional confidence.' Well, indeed, and why shouldn't she feel that way? Joanna has quite a passion for the queer intimacy afforded her by her craft. To me she says, 'I met a woman in France last year who said to me, 'You've been sitting in my kitchen for the last three years!''' She admits, quite shamelessly, that she conducts numerous interviews as part of the research for her novels, but when I put it to her that this suggests she doesn't have much faith in her imagination, she vehemently asserts: 'I'm not looking for information; I'm looking for what I expect to be the case to be confirmed.' She's been quite nettled by reviewers who've said that her thirtysomethings in the latest book wouldn't use the archaisms she ascribes to them - 'I wanted to hear it in their language, the urgency of their feelings...' I think the truth is that her interviewees - whom Joanna obtains by word of mouth - come from exactly her milieu, and that explains why they all sound rather like characters in a Joanna Trollope novel. This quite blinkered perception of the world is common to the novelist and the books. Joanna is the sort of woman who says, 'I'm just like every woman of my generation: we can all speak adequate French, we all went to ballet class and we can all ride.' The missing adjectives in her sentence being, quite clearly, 'upper-middle-class English'. In a whole class, we would call this attitude bigotry; in a single woman of Joanna's age and breadth of experience, one can only call it naivety. Her observations on the current generation of thirtysomethings, as against her own generation at that age, are inconsistent and near-contradictory. She says to me at one point: 'They're not politicised like my generation were at university. There's no clear-cut ambition for the world the way I remember it at university in the Sixties.' Yet a few minutes later she announces: 'There's a freedom for radicalism now that there really wasn't when I was growing up. I mean, that was one of the things that charmed me about the age group in this book - how free they are of so many of the assumptions and prejudices that we all grew up with in the Sixties.' Still, I wouldn't wish tedious consistency on Joanna, any more than I want her dragged back to the shires, kicking and screaming. She concedes that her success and consequent wealth have divorced her somewhat from her readers, but she's determined not to lose touch with 'the little daily lacerations of the spirit' that she writes so acutely about. I suspect the truth is that while Joanna remains so in thrall to the way she and her work are received by the world, there are plenty more little lacerations in store for her. And that's quite a shame. Space shuttle Columbia and a crew of seven blasted into orbit this morning on a mission to renovate the Hubble Space Telescope. After a one-day wait for warmer weather, Columbia went into clouds just before dawn as Hubble was passing nearly overhead. The launch was surrounded by extraordinarily tight security to guard against possible terrorist attack. F-15 fighter jets were on patrol, and a no-fly zone was in force within 35 miles of the launch pad. Nasa's oldest shuttle, fresh from an overhaul, had a perfect start to its 11-day flight. 'It's been two years and seven months since Columbia last flew,' said shuttle manager James Halsell. 'It got onto orbit without even as much as a minor fault message, much less any type of major alarm.' Columbia is loaded with $172 million of scientific, power and steering parts for Hubble. The astronauts will conduct five spacewalks next week to install all the equipment on the 12-year-old telescope. The parts include stronger solar wings, more robust power-control unit, more reliable steering mechanism, refrigeration system to resuscitate a disabled infrared camera, and advanced camera to increase Hubble's capability for discovery by 10 times. Nasa considers this the most complicated Hubble servicing mission yet because of the heavy workload and a pair of unprecedented spacewalking jobs. Neither the power-control unit nor infrared camera repairs were meant to be tackled in orbit. Before the old power-control unit can be removed and the new one installed, all of Hubble's systems must be turned off for the first time ever in orbit. Scientist say there is a greater chance that the current power unit will eventually fail than there is that the telescope, or even a major portion of it, will not come back on following the repairs. This is Nasa's fourth visit to Hubble. The first service call, in 1993, corrected the telescope's blurred vision. One more servicing mission is planned after this one, in 2004. Then if Nasa has its way, the telescope will be returned to Earth in 2010 for museum display. 'Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!' was a well-known, and much remembered, phrase from a sketch in the Monty Python series of the early 1970s. But now, at last, the Spanish can get their own back by chortling 'Todos saber de uno soldado marino Ingles!' whenever the odd Royal Marine crops up on one of their beaches by mistake. The Spanish policeman, who reacted with charming aplomb at the invasion that never was, will probably be kicking himself that he didn't come up with, 'Good morning, Commander Bond, we've been expecting you.' Nevertheless, the Spanish emerge with great credit for not over-reacting to the tread of foreign boots on their sand. In Elizabethan times, a dead monkey washed up on a beach would spread alarm and anxiety about imminent invasion and Protestant plots. But now the Spanish have the experience, derived from decades of watching tattooed Brits, in replica football shirts, trashing their coastal towns, and this has probably reduced the Spanish authorities to a weary acceptance of the extremes of our behaviour. Indeed they might well have believed that the incoming commandos were an advance party of hooligans doing a recce for a forthcoming Champions' League game. Rather than counter-attack, or run away, somebody in the Spanish chain of command must have realised pretty quickly that here was a golden chance to neutralise certain long-running Iberian stereotypes, and set up some new Anglo-Saxon ones instead. 'Forget the magnificence of Sir Francis Drake raiding Cadiz, he is so over. Now, your English public-school officer class cannot even find Gibraltar on a sunny day. Ha!' Indeed, it is the negotiations over the future of Gibraltar's sovereignty that will have been most affected, to Spanish advantage, by this incident. You can imagine the quiet smirks on the faces of Spanish diplomats when they next meet their British counterparts. The amusing thought may cross the Spanish consciousness that they are no longer dealing with a democratically elected government that is a partner to Spain in the European Community, but an out-of-control junta ready to turn to military force at the slightest excuse. Didn't the British government run something rather sinister up the flagpole last week, about licensing mercenaries to enact foreign policy? Could this have been the first dry run for these 'rogue elements', giving a warning to Spain about what might kick off if they do get their hands on Gibraltar? The timing is suspicious to say the least. In all cold wars, the enemy likes to test the nerves of its opponents. Some of you may remember all those Soviet fish-factory ships that used to cruise the North Sea, eavesdropping on our radio transmissions and looking for weaknesses in the eastern seaboard defences. So perhaps the Spanish shouldn't feel so smug after all. Maybe it is all a combined 'Save Gibraltar Faction/Dogs of War' plot to destabilise Se¤or Aznar's confidence in El Tony Blair? Such conspiracy theories will be laid aside in due course, once we realise that the Spanish invasion of Britain has been completed in mostly harmonious circumstances. There are the hundreds of bright and noble Spanish nurses who are helping out our beleaguered National Health Service in and around Blackpool. We should not forget either how much employment the Spanish magazine Hola! has brought to this country for the hard- working photographers and front-line journalists of Hello!, its English counterpart. The Spanish have also taken over a large share of our south-western fishing fleet, and nobody will need reminding that a certain Enrique Iglesias has topped the British pop charts for the past three weeks. Bravo!
Our best scientists used to be confined to university research. Now Britain is profiting from their genius. Some criticisms of Britain come and go, others seem impossible to shift. For nearly a century, this country has lived with a sorry fact: we have a disproportionate number of the world's most inventive scientific minds, but are truly terrible at exploiting them. But all that is becoming a thing of the past. The market bubble of 1999-2000 showed that science, in all its forms, has a huge capacity to excite. Small, university- originated companies such as Osmetech, which makes a hi-tech 'nose', De Novo Pharmaceuticals, which makes gene-based medicine, and the nano- technology researcher Oxonica are just three that have sprung up and become the target of massive investment. A wave of enthusiasm is washing over the UK's academic scientific community as the belief grows that its work may, finally, see the commercial light of day. A lot of the problem has been structural. The scientific brains have traditionally been locked away in academic institutions. Within Britain's top universities, extraordinary advances in medical science, engineering and computing have been made, but found nowhere to go. In recent years, the issue has been particularly acute in biotechnology, where the pace of progress in gene and protein discovery, and its application to medicine, has outstripped all expectations. But now, spurred partly by the stock-market success of a few high-profile companies, vice chancellors have realised it is time to extract real value from their laboratory treasures. The market bubble may have burst, but there are still plenty of venture capitalists ready to dish money out to good ideas, and the academic world is playing its part. The products of these collaborations are known as spin-outs, and they are fast becoming the pride and joy of the universities. Spin-out companies, both small and large, are emerging from their alma maters at the rate of more than 10 a month. Two factors are at work. The first is that the Government, under fire for not making more of British research and fearing another 1960s-style brain drain, has set up funding for the commercialisation of research in universities. The second is that the universities themselves have been even more energetic in setting up bodies to promote the spin-outs. Each has gone about it in a different way, but among the top research faculties, the results have been similar. As Peter Hiscocks, director of the Cambridge Entrepreneurship Centre (CEC), says: 'There has been an important change of culture and there is starting to be a real entrepreneurial spirit among academics. A lot of it has been about giving scientists a confidence many of them did not have.' As the universities have embraced industry via the spin-outs, they have encountered many of the problems regularly faced by industry, such as the ownership of intellectual property (IP), funding and equity distribution. Coping with these has become a crucial task for these newly formed enterprise bodies. Oxford University has produced some of the highest-profile spin-outs in recent years, achieving a particular string of successes in biotechnology. Listed companies such as PowderJect, Oxford Glycosciences and Oxford Biomedica fall into this category, but have been joined more lately by spin-outs such as Oxford Ancestors, which uses DNA links to track genealogy, and Oxford BioSignals, which works in neuroscience. Oxford's success is largely due to its early adoption of spin-outs. In 1988 the university set up Isis, a subsidiary devoted to finding ways to commercialise its research. As its director, Tom Hockaday, says: 'Though efforts have increased recently, for 14 years Isis has been helping scientists to spin out companies. Most of our time is spent explaining to the university how industry works and to industry about how the university works.' Oxford has traditionally maintained ownership of all the IP created by its research departments, and taken stakes in the spin-outs. Very recently, it adopted a unique partnership with a company called IP2IPO, a venture half owned by the investment bank Beeson Gregory. In a deal struck last year, Oxford received œ20m to build a new chemistry lab on the basis that IP2IPO would have the rights to 50 per cent of the value of any IP generated in the chemistry department over the next 15 years. The structure has already produced two advanced materials spin-outs: Inhibox and Pharminox. Cambridge, meanwhile, has adopted a different approach. Situated at the heart of Silicon Fen amid 1,500 hi-tech firms, Cambridge has long been a powerhouse of commercialised scientific research. But much of it has arrived there without being closely tied to the university. Its emphasis is on education; it does not want to be seen to be pushing academics, but is dedicated to making it easier for them if they want to go commercial. 'Our mission is to build an entrepreneurial culture at Cambridge University, by teaching skills to the sort of people that will make ventures successful. We have signed up thousands of students to our 18 courses: one of the most popular is the 'Basics of Building a Business',' says CEC director Mr Hiscocks. For spin-outs that take contracts out with the three- year-old CEC, the university helps with finding investors and arranging mentoring by some of its older success stories, and takes a 3 per cent equity stake. Now working at the rate of two deals a week, Cambridge has produced 120 spin-outs over the past 10 years. Two of the most famous are ARM and Autonomy, which rapidly rose to the ranks of the FTSE 100. More recent spin-outs include Akubio, a ground-breaking technology that allows accurate virus detection from 'dirty' blood samples. One 'innovations faculty' that is close to breaking even belongs to London's Imperial College. Its body, Imperial College Innovations, has produced 50 spin-outs since 1997. As its director, Brian Graves, explains, the IP belongs to the college at first. Then, once the spin- out is complete, it is assigned to the new entity and Imperial takes a chunk of equity. Turbo Genset, the power generation company, is among its most famous sons, and ones to watch include Powerlase and CERES in engineering, and Gene Expression Technologies in biotech. A similar approach has been taken at Southampton University. Its body, the Centre for Enterprise and Innovation (CEI), has produced several highly commercial pieces of research, and the flow of spin-outs is rising fast. Its director, Tony Raven, says: 'We try to be pragmatic. If there is just one good idea, we try to sell it to a company. But if the idea looks as though it will lead to a string of other ideas that can be commercialised, we encourage the creation of a spin-out. Photonics is the prime example.' A very different, but highly successful approach has come from UMIST in Manchester. Unlike other universities, UMIST has set up its own venture capital-style company to carry the scientific research through the whole process of incorporation. Its chief executive, Clive Rowland, is firm: 'Some universities use a general ward approach, with a consultant coming in every so often. We prefer an intensive care approach. We are on top of the project all the time, and we accordingly have very few casualties. We don't like the sink or swim mentality.' Significantly, researchers at UMIST own their IP from the outset. Prime successes have been Phototherapeutics, a medical company, and VICs, a pioneer of video imaging on mobile phones. The spin-out era is clearly upon us, and many believe it could have enough impetus to blow away the traditional shortcomings of British industry's relationship with science. As Chris Wright, chief executive of IP2IPO, says: 'This is the perfect time to be in the business of scientific and hi-tech spin-outs. The Government is ready, industry is ready, the academics are ready and the investors are ready.' With most big companies admitting that the days of their final salary pension scheme are numbered, many employees will find themselves with a smaller retirement income than they may have anticipated. Ernst & Young and Iceland both recently closed their final salary schemes, not only to new members but to future contributions from existing members. The schemes are thought too risky and expensive because of the poor performance of the stock market, the rise in life expectancy and Labour's tax raid on pension funds since 1997. To ease the burden, the Government last week announced that it was relaxing the minimum funding requirement (MFR), which ensures that pension funds have enough cash to pay people on retirement. But much of the damage has already been done. In the past 10 years, says the TUC, the number of people in final salary plans has fallen by 1.8 million, leaving just 3.8 million in the schemes. So what has happened to those who have lost their final salary benefits? Only 200,000 are likely to have transferred to money purchase schemes, leaving 1.6 million fewer people with any form of occupational pension. And with the recent acceleration in the closure of final salary schemes, the real decline may be even higher. 'Over the last decade, both employers and the state have been shifting responsibility for pensions provision on to individual employees, many of whom have no idea how poor they will be when they retire or simply do not have the spare cash to make the savings needed to build up a sufficient pension pot of their own,' says John Monks, TUC General Secretary. Final salary schemes guarantee that you will get a fixed proportion of your salary, usually two- thirds, in retirement. But when employers close them, they are usually replaced with defined contribution - or money purchase - schemes, which have no such guarantee. The final pension is not determined by final salary but by a combination of the performance of the underlying investments and annuity rates at retirement. They are much cheaper for employers, as their contributions tend to be much lower, while the employee takes on all the stock market risk. If you find yourself in this position, much will depend on the benefits built up in your final salary scheme so far, which should be safe. There are fears that those nearing retirement will be worst hit, as they will have less time to do anything about the changes, but if you have been a member of your final salary scheme for a long time, the chances are that it will still make up a significant part of your pension. Those likely to feel the greatest impact are employees in their late thirties or early forties. 'With final salary schemes, the value of the employer's contribution increases the older you get,' says Adrian Boulding, pensions strategy director at Legal & General. 'So at the age of 20 your employer might pay 5 per cent of salary, increasing to 20 per cent by the age of 55. If you are turfed out of your final salary scheme into money purchase halfway through your career, you will never get the high-value contribution. These people are really going to lose out and are most likely to need to top up their pensions.' Everybody's situation is different, and it is a good idea to get independent financial advice. If you are on higher earnings with complex benefits arrangements, you may be able to negotiate with your employer to fund this advice. Most employers will offer a money purchase scheme in place of the final salary pension. If you have a choice, do your sums carefully before accepting, as it is likely to mean a huge loss for you. 'If you are offered the option of staying with the final salary scheme or moving over to a money purchase scheme, as many firms are giving their staff, you should stay put,' advises Donna Bradshaw, director of independent financial adviser Fiona Price & Partners. 'The money purchase scheme may have very high employer contributions, but even so, you are better off with the final salary scheme.' If your only option is to join a money purchase scheme, it is worth doing so, as your employer will contribute. Work out how much this will be and how much it will cost to replace the benefits you would have received as part of your final salary scheme, such as life cover. Compare this with how much you think you will need to live on in retirement. You will have to make up the shortfall, which may be possible through additional contributions to your employer's money purchase scheme. Alternatively, your company may have an additional voluntary contribution (AVC) scheme that you can put money into. Or you could opt for a stakeholder-style plan: if you earn less than œ30,000, you can invest in a stakeholder alongside your money purchase scheme. 'What is important is to shop around,' advises Mr Boulding, 'and find out which is the most attractive vehicle in terms of the charges and range of investments.' The Sangatte refugee camp has become the focus for the xenophobic tendency on this side of the Channel. But the existence of the camp does not give rise to the nightly game of train-hopping at rail yards near the French tunnel entrance. As the chief executive of the Refugee Council said yesterday, Sangatte is a 'symptom not the cause' of the pressure generated by people wanting to come to Britain. Asylum-seekers and economic migrants are desperate to get to these shores, not because of the cornucopia of state benefits which are available (they are not), nor because we are unusually soft when it comes to enforcing immigration laws (we are not), but because we speak English and have a strong, full-employment economy. The British should regard the modern siege of Calais as a compliment and a potential benefit, rather than a threat. This country can gain a great deal, as it has in the past, from the determination, hard work and enterprise of immigrants. Many of those refused refugee status should be invited to settle here and make a contribution to our economic and cultural life. There are always likely to be, however, more people who want to come than will be granted permission, and so borders will have to be policed. As an island nation, the practicalities are simpler than they are for other EU countries. But the saga of Sangatte has shown that, in immigration matters, no country is an island. Ideally, a common immigration and asylum policy should be agreed at EU level. That would make a reality of the idea of European citizenship. Sadly, such an enforceable agreement is unlikely in the near future. However, if David Blunkett develops his plans to allow limited immigration - in addition to our duty of compassion towards those fleeing persecution - it will make it easier to control the train-riders and lorry- jumpers throughout the European transport network. If economic migrants are offered the prospect of legal entry, they will be marginally less likely to resort to desperate means of entry.
After England's overwhelming defeat of the admired Ireland - how long ago it now seems - the London press, sober broadsheets as much as xenophobic tabloids, outdid even Welsh supporters of the 1970s in lack of realism and sheer conceit; which is saying something. I did not undervalue the victory over an Ireland side who, as they showed against Scotland on Saturday, can pile up points even though they may be losing the set pieces. What I did do, several times, was warn against a French team in Paris who had already beaten South Africa and New Zealand before Christmas. True, several of the young backs who had participated in those wins (every bit as significant as England's at Twickenham) were unavailable to the French coach, Bernard Laporte. But it was still clear he was moving towards the side he wanted, despite the disappointing performances against Italy and Wales. Accordingly, I find myself slightly in the position of the late politician William Whitelaw, speaking on the Prom at Brighton to a friend and myself. Edward Heath had just told the Tory conference that it would be wrong to gloat over the misfortunes of the Labour government of the late 1970s. 'I can tell you,' Whitelaw said, 'that I'm gloating like hell.' It is one thing to be buoyed up with confidence; quite another to believe you are the best in the world. It is doubtful whether the England players really thought that. But no one could have blamed them if they had. They were certainly told it often enough over the past fortnight. For this delusion the newspapers are primarily responsible. They fell for the Zurich financial services company's computer calculations with all the uncritical enthusiasm of a nine-year-old presented with a PlayStation on his birthday. A few months ago I was seated next to a suit from Zurich at a luncheon. He was a perfectly agreeable companion, a Scot, as many of these insurance coves seem to be. He said that few people seemed to know what Zurich was or what it did. Hence the company's sponsorship of various activities and, in particular, its involvement in rugby union. Nothing wrong with this. The company wants publicity and is prepared, up to a point, to pay for it. But the claim that a computer calculation can determine which country is, at any given moment, top of the world is frankly preposterous. There is certainly a way of arriving at such a conclusion. This is not through the World Cup, which is partly dependent on the luck of the draw. It is, rather, through a competition involving Australia, England, France, New Zealand and South Africa. The countries would play one another home and away - something that does not happen in the Six Nations' Championship, though it should. The competition could, I estimate, be completed before Christmas if it started early enough in the autumn. Alternatively, there is no reason whatsoever why it should not be held in the summer which, in northern Europe at any rate, is an entirely suitable season for rugby. The championship could be held at four-yearly intervals, by setting the gap between World Cups. I do not, I may say, seriously suppose that such a competition will come about in the immediate future or, perhaps, ever. But it would be preferable to the somewhat haphazard pre-Christmas matches and the even more capriciously arranged summer tours. And it would dispose of pieces of nonsense like the Zurich computer. It is doubtful whether England would have won in Paris whatever plan they had adopted, or however quick-witted they might have been in varying it. The surprising thing about the match was not so much that England did not adopt Plan B, if there was one. It was more that, according to several reports, they failed to implement Plan A. Certainly, it was madness to think, as they presumably did once on the pitch, that they could beat this or, indeed, virtually any French side by running at them from inside their own 22. Martin Johnson foolishly chose to kick to touch near the goal-line when he should have taken the three penalty points on offer - though, to be fair, Jason Robinson's try came from one such adventurous decision. On other occasions Robinson, Kyran Bracken, Jonny Wilkinson and Will Greenwood, who otherwise had a fine match, were all culpable in failing to boot the ball into touch when they had the opportunity. At one point Johnson, urging this course, looked round in despair. I sympathised slightly. The French crowd treated him as if he were the Demon Poisoner of Alsace who, along with the President's African Diamonds and the Headless Corpse in the Bois de Boulogne, is one of the staple subjects of French newspaper stories. Much worse things than Johnson's punch at Vicarage Road go on in French club rugby every single weekend of the season. Last year, the number of teachers resigning from state schools doubled. Sarah Cassidy looks at how ministers are trying to staunch the haemorrhage. The teacher shortage crisis has not gone away, according to official statistics posted on a government website this week. Teacher vacancies have almost doubled in a year, leaving state schools short of more than 5,000 teachers, with nearly 2,700 of these in secondary schools. The new figures come in the same months as Mike Tomlinson, the chief inspector of schools, warned that teacher shortages have become a 'real' problem threatening to jeopardise standards in schools. And a recent study conducted for the National Union of Teachers found that almost 60 per cent of trainee teachers leave the profession within three years of entering the classroom. The number of full-time teachers resigning doubled from 26,000 in 1998 to 52,000 last year, with each secondary school losing an average of 10 teachers. Yet despite these gloomy predictions there are now 7,000 more teachers in schools than 12 months ago, and 12,000 more than in 1997. That is because many heads with healthy school balances have used the money to create extra jobs. Meanwhile entries to teacher training in England are at their highest level for seven years. However, there are still nowhere near enough secondary school recruits. Teacher recruitment experts warn that the situation could reach a new crisis point in September when a new, larger cohort of 11-year-olds threatens to swell secondary school rolls by around 40,000 pupils. More than 2,000 extra teachers will be needed just to keep class sizes at their current levels, say teacher recruitment experts. The teacher shortage 'meltdown' predicted by teaching unions, however, has so far failed to materialise. Schools have not been forced to run four-day weeks but many are struggling with vacancies that are proving impossible to fill. This is because head teachers are using every 'weapon at their disposal' to ensure that children do not have to be sent home, says David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers. Heads are relying on supply staff, getting existing staff to cover for vacancies, rearranging the timetable or even teaching children in large groups. 'Essentially, schools have only kept going by relying on the good will of the existing staff. But this does not always mean that pupils are getting a good deal,' argues Alan Smithers, director of Liverpool University's centre for education and employment. 'Staff may be expected to teach outside their subject or the continuity of children's education could be put at risk by a succession of supply staff.' A growing number of supply teachers is being used to plug the gaps. Of the 465,000 teachers in the country, around 19,000 are supply staff, compared with just over 12,000 in 1995. John Howson, managing director of Education Data Surveys, estimates that supply teachers are costing schools more than œ600 million, with agencies taking about œ200 million of that total. 'In secondary, it's quite clear that the Government's training grants and golden hellos are having a significant difference in some subjects,' he says. 'However, there is still concern that even with the increased number of applications it's still not going to be enough to hit the targets in some subjects, such as maths.' Hart warns that this trend is draining schools' budgets, arguing that the cost of supply staff has 'gone through the roof'. It can cost schools up to œ200 a day to hire a supply teacher, he says. One London school has spent œ37,000 on supply staff, according to Mr Hart. Supply agencies have received a spate of bad publicity recently. One agency, Timeplan, found itself at the centre of a storm of criticism in the wake of the trial of Amy Gehring, the Canadian supply teacher cleared of indecently assaulting school boys, but who admitted having behaved inappropriately. The agency had failed to pass on a warning that Miss Gehring might pose a risk to children. Ofsted has also found problems with the quality of supply staff, saying that they often missed out on specialist training and were not as good as permanent teachers. Tomlinson's 2000-01 annual report concluded: 'They perform less well than any other category of teacher, with less than half of their lessons being good or better compared with two- thirds of the lessons of qualified and permanent members of staff. In the most extreme cases, the difficulty of recruiting sufficient teachers to teach every class in the school is a major issue.' Inspectors found that in secondary schools, one in 25 vacancies was filled by supply teachers. This was having a damaging effect on subjects including modern foreign languages, science and religious education, they concluded. Schools received their share of the blame for failing to give supply staff enough advice on lesson planning, teaching methods and how to manage behaviour, Ofsted added. The situation was worst in deprived areas. 'The proportion of poor teaching was considerably higher among temporary or supply teachers,' said the Inspectorate. 'In schools serving disadvantaged communities, one third of the lessons taught by these teachers was unsatisfactory or poor.' But the agencies themselves cite Ofsted's other finding - that teaching standards in general have never been higher - and argue that supply staff should share the credit for this success. David Rose, of Select Education, an agency that finds supply staff 15,000 days of work every week, admits that temporary teachers can be 'slightly outside the loop' for the latest training but argues that the agency spent œ300,000 on training its supply staff last year. 'I think that schools appreciate what we do because they realise that without the agencies these jobs would be much harder to fill,' he says. 'We put in a lot of work matching the right people to the right job. We are not just there for emergency cover - we also help head teachers find long- term solutions to hard-to-fill vacancies. Up to 60 per cent of our people are in long-term positions of a month or more. It's only really where there is a real shortage of teachers in certain subjects in secondary schools that there's a real problem.' Estelle Morris, the Education Secretary, promised to make tackling teacher shortages her top priority when she was promoted after last summer's General Election. She insists that the Government's recruitment and retention efforts are having an effect and plans to 're-model' the profession to encourage schools to make more use of classroom assistants. 'All the evidence is that what we are doing on recruitment is working and what I'm sure about, as part of retention, is giving teachers more support. The money is there but the culture and structure to buy in that support, rather than always buy extra teachers, isn't there,' Ms Morris said recently. Head teachers believe, however, that more needs to be done to make teaching more attractive. The official figures tell only half the story, they argue. And the teacher shortage is far worse than even the latest statistics suggest, they warn. 'Improvements to recruitment and retention of teachers can only be won by making the job much more attractive both to those already doing it and to potential recruits,' says John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association. No one is accusing the Government of complacency. According to David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, ministers believe that the improved teacher recruitment figures will do the trick. The challenge is to stop the haemorrhage of staff from the profession because of stress and excessive workload. 'If the Chancellor does not produce the money to deliver a decent workload reduction package then I believe the situation is really quite grim,' he says. American computer giant IBM is so obsessed with miniaturisation that it is diverting huge resources into building microscopic computers. The company, which spends $6bn (œ4.2bn) a year on research and development, has decided that the future lies in machines that are practically invisible to the naked eye. IBM will be spending a 'significant proportion' of its research budget on the science of nanotechnology, the process of making devices the size of a single molecule. Some analysts believe the project will run into billions of dollars. IBM's excitement over the potential of nanotechnology has been spurred to new heights by a report by the US National Science Foundation which forecasts that the global nanotech market will be worth $1 trillion (œ700bn) in the next 10 years. That growth will be achieved by making many existing technologies redundant. 'This will be very disruptive stuff,' a spokesman said. The company believes it will shortly be possible to string molecule-sized processors together to form a tiny but enormously powerful computer, and that it may eventually be possible to shrink the supercomputers that now fill rooms to the size of a wristwatch. IBM is investigating many potential uses for the new technology, including the design of self-repairing materials and machines. Another use is producing sensors that can detect infinitesimal changes in atomic structure. This is expected to lead to devices that can instantly detect biological or chemical weapons, an idea that has caused great interest in the Pentagon. But IBM's chief focus will be on the potential computing power of nanotechnology. The group has created a prototype of a transistor that uses carbon rather than silicon. The different material allows its inventors to produce a transistor 50,000 times thinner than a human hair. IBM researchers have even speculated that nanotechnology could replace silicon chips and hard disks because information will eventually be able to be stored at the atomic level. IBM's drive to embrace nanotechnology coincides with growing interest from global governments and investors. A US government initiative has an annual budget of $604m, and other countries are pushing ahead too.

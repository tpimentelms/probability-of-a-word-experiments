In Ireland's County Limerick, near the River Shannon, there is a quiet little suburb by the name of Garryowen, which means "Garden of Owen." Undoubtedly none of the residents realize the influence their town has had on American military history, or the deeds of valor that have been done in its name. The cry "Garryowen!" Bursting from the lips of a charging cavalry trooper was the last sound heard on this earth by untold numbers of Cheyennes, Sioux and Apaches, Mexican banditos under Pancho Villa, Japanese in the South Pacific, and Chinese and North Korean Communists in Korea. Garryowen is the battle cry of the 7th U.S. Cavalry Regiment, "The Fighting Seventh." Today a battle cry may seem an anachronism, for in the modern Army, esprit de corps has been sacrificed to organizational charts and tables. But don't tell that to a veteran of the Fighting Seventh, especially in a saloon on Saturday night. Of all the thousands of men who have served in the 7th Cav, perhaps no one knows its spirit better than Lieutenant Colonel Melbourne C. Chandler. Wiry and burr-headed, with steel blue eyes and a chest splattered with medals, Chandler is the epitome of the old-time trooper. The truth is, however, that when Mel Chandler first reported to the regiment the only steed he had ever ridden was a swivel chair and the only weapon he had ever wielded was a pencil. Chandler had been commissioned in the Medical Service Corps and was serving as a personnel officer for the Kansas City Medical Depot when he decided that if he was going to make the Army his career, he wanted to be in the fighting part of it. Though he knew no more about military science and tactics than any other desk officer, he managed to get transferred to the combat forces. The next thing he knew he was reporting for duty as commanding officer of Troop H, 7th Cavalry, in the middle of corps maneuvers in Japan. Outside of combat, he couldn't have landed in a tougher spot. First of all, no unit likes to have a new CO brought in from the outside, especially when he's an armchair trooper. Second, if there is ever a perfect time to pull the rug out from under him, it's on maneuvers. In combat, helping your CO make a fool of himself might mean getting yourself killed. But in maneuvers, with the top brass watching him all the time, it's easy. Chandler understood this and expected the worst. But his first few days with Troop H were full of surprises, beginning with First Sergeant Robert Early. Chandler had expected a tough old trooper with a gravel voice. Instead Sergeant Early was quiet, sharp and confident. He had enlisted in the Army straight out of high school and had immediately set about learning his new trade. There was no weapon Early could not take apart and reassemble blind-folded. He could lead a patrol and he knew his paper work. Further, he had taken full advantage of the Army's correspondence courses. He not only knew soldiering, but mathematics, history and literature as well. But for all his erudite confidence, Sergeant Early was right out of the Garryowen mold. He was filled with the spirit of the Fighting Seventh. That saved Mel Chandler. Sergeant Early let the new CO know just how lucky he was to be in the best troop in the best regiment in the United States Army. He fed the captain bits of history about the troops and the regiment. For example, it was a battalion of the 7th Cavalry under Colonel George Armstrong Custer that had been wiped out at the Battle of The Little Big Horn. It didn't take Captain Chandler long to realize that he had to carry a heavy load of tradition on his shoulders as commander of Troop A. But what made the load lighter was the realization that every officer, non-com and trooper was ready and willing to help him carry it, for the good of the troop and the regiment.
O'Banion was a complex and frightening man, whose bright blue eyes stared with a kind of frozen candour into others'. He had a round, frank Irish face, creased in a jovial grin that stayed bleakly in place even when he was pumping bullets into someone's body. He carried three guns, one in the right trouser pocket, one under his left armpit, one in the left outside coat pocket, and was equally lethal with both hands. He killed accurately, freely, and dispassionately. The police credited him with twenty-five murders but he was never brought to trial for one of them. Like a fair number of bootleggers he disliked alcohol. He was an expert florist, tenderly dextrous in the arrangement of bouquets and wreaths. He had no apparent comprehension of morality; he divided humanity into "right guys" and "wrong guys," and the wrong ones he was always willing to kill and trample under. He had what was described by a psychologist as a "sunny brutality." He walked with a heavy list to the right, as that leg was four inches shorter than the other, but the lurch did not reduce his feline quickness with his guns. Landesco thought him "just a superior sort of plugugly" but he was, in fact, with his aggression and hostility, and nerveless indifference to risking or administering pain, a casebook psychopath. He was also at this time, although not so interwoven in high politics and the rackets as Torrio and Capone, the most powerful and most dangerous mob leader in the Chicago underworld, the roughneck king.
Chairs scraped back and customers hastily vacated their tables as the tall young buffalo hunter pushed open the swing doors and walked towards the bar. Only Blue Throat and his gang stayed where they were. Blue Throat was slumped with his back against the bar, elbows supporting his massive frame. He leered at the stranger as the distance between them closed. "Since when did they allow beardless kids into the saloon bars of this town, boys?" he asked. "Seems to me I don't remember altering any law about that." He straightened up, alert now as the buffalo hunter came closer. "Stay right here where you are, kid," he called. "I don't aim to have minors breathing down my neck when I'm a-drinking." The stranger ignored him. He didn't stop till he was within three feet of Blue Throat and by that time the gang leader's right hand was on the butt of his revolver. "I'm Billy Tilghman," said the stranger, "and I've come for Pat Conyers' body." "And what makes you think you're going to get it, pretty boy?" "Because I'm asking. Most of the time I get what I ask for." Blue Throat winked at his six cronies. "The kid has no manners, boys. Shall we teach him some?" His gun was half drawn when he asked the question, but the weapon never left its holster. Tilghman's clenched fist swept over in a terrific right cross and clipped the big gunfighter on the side of his chin. His head snapped round and he reeled back, crashing into the table where his buddies were sprawling. Tilghman leapt on to him, dragged him upright and hit him again, this time sending him careening against the bar. A bullet gouged into the bar top an inch from Tilghman's stomach as Blue Throat's henchmen started shooting. Tilghman flung himself aside, dropped on one knee and pulled his own gun. The Colt roared twice and two men dropped, writhing. A third shot doused the light. Somewhere at the far end of the room a voice yelled, "You all right, Billy?" "Yes, George, but I ain't got poor old Pat's body yet. And I aim to have it." He fired again, and somewhere in the gloom a man screamed. Another took off his gun belt and flung his weapons to the floor. "OK, Tilghman, I'm quitting." "And me," said another Blue Throat henchman. Somebody brought a light. Tilghman and his partner, George Rust, herded the men into a corner. "And now," said Tilghman with deadly calm, "I'll repeat what I said. I've come for Pat Conyers' body." In two minutes the body of Tilghman's former comrade, who had been killed by Blue Throat in a gambling brawl the previous night, was carried into the town's funeral parlor to be prepared for decent burial. Blue Throat, nursing an aching jaw and a colossal dose of wounded pride, rode out of town with the survivors of the fight. "That critter will be back tomorrow," predicted George Rust, "and he'll bring fifty of his kind back with him. Blue Throat won't stand for this. He'll shoot up the town."
She was just another freighter from the States, and she seemed as commonplace as her name. She was the John Harvey, one of those Atlantic sea-horses that had sailed to Bari to bring beans, bombs, and bullets to the U.S. Fifteenth Air Force, to Field Marshal Montgomery's Eighth Army then racing up the calf of the boot of Italy in that early December of 1943. The John Harvey arrived in Bari, a port on the Adriatic, on November 28th, making for Porto Nuovo, which, as the name indicates, was the ancient city's new and modern harbor. Hardly anyone ashore marked her as she anchored stern-to off Berth 29 on the mole. If anyone thought of the John Harvey, it was to observe that she was straddled by a pair of ships heavily laden with high explosive and if they were hit the John Harvey would likely be blown up with her own ammo and whatever else it was that she carried. Which was poison gas. It had required the approval of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt before the John Harvey could be loaded with 100 tons of mustard gas and dispatched to the Italian warfront. For in a world as yet unacquainted with the horrors of the mushroom cloud, poison gas was still regarded as the ultimate in hideous weapons. Throughout the early years of World War II, reports persisted that the Axis powers had used gas, Germany in Russia, Japan in China again. They were always denied. Influential people in America were warning the Pentagon to be prepared against desperation gas attacks by the Germans in future campaigns. Some extremists went so far as to urge our using it first. To silence extremists, to warn the Axis, President Roosevelt issued this statement for the Allies in August: "From time to time since the present war began there have been reports that one or more of the Axis powers were seriously contemplating use of poisonous gas or noxious gases or other inhumane devices of warfare. I have been loath to believe that any nation, even our present enemies, could or would be willing to loose upon mankind such terrible and inhumane weapons. "However, evidence that the Axis powers are making significant preparations indicative of such an intention is being reported with increasing frequency from a variety of sources. "Use of such weapons has been outlawed by the general opinion of civilized mankind. This country has not used them, and I hope that we never will be compelled to use them. I state categorically that we shall under no circumstances resort to the use of such weapons unless they are first used by our enemies." The following month the invasion of Italy was begun, and Roosevelt gave effect to his warning by consenting to the stockpiling of poison gas in southern Italy. Bari was chosen as a depot, not only for its seeming safety, but because of its proximity to airfields. Any retaliatory gas attack would be airborne. It would be made in three waves, the first to lay down a smokescreen, the second to drop the gas bombs, the third to shower incendiaries which would burn everything below. So the vile cargo went into the hole of the John Harvey. A detachment of six men from the 701st Chemical Maintenance Company under First Lt. Howard D. Beckstrom went aboard, followed by Lt. Thomas H. Richardson, the Cargo Security Officer. Secrecy was paramount. Only a few other people, very important people, knew of the nitrogen-mustard eggs nestled below decks. No one else must know. Thus, in the immemorial way, in the way of the right hand that knows and the left that does not, was the stage set for tragedy at Bari.
Franklin D. Lee proved a man of prompt action when Mrs. Claire Shaefer, accompanied by a friend, visited him in Bakersfield, California, several months ago as a prospective patient. "Doctor" Lee asked her to lie down on a bed and remove her shoes. Then, by squeezing her foot three times, he came up, presto, with a different diagnosis with each squeeze. She had, he informed her, kidney trouble, liver trouble, and a severe female disorder. (He explained that he could diagnose these ailments from squeezing her foot because all of the nervous system was connected to it.) He knew just the thing for her, a treatment from his "cosmic light ozone generator" machine. As he applied the applicator extending from the machine, which consisted of seven differently colored neon tubes superimposed on a rectangular base, to the supposedly diseased portions of Mrs. Shaefer's body, Lee kept up a steady stream of pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo. Yes, the ozone from his machine would cure practically everything, he assured her. Did she know, he asked, why the colors of the tubes were important to people's health? The human body, he pointed out, for example, required 33 units of blue light. For that reason, he informed her, the Lord made the sky blue. Continuing glibly in this vein, he paused to comfort her: "Don't you worry. This machine will cure your cancer-ridden body." "Cancer!" Mrs. Shaefer practically shrieked. "You didn't tell me I had cancer." "You have it, all right. But as long as you can have treatment from my machine you have nothing to worry about. Why, I once used this machine to cure a woman with 97 pounds of cancer in her body." He urged her to buy one of his machines, for $300. When she said that she didn't have the money, he said that she could come in for treatment with his office model until she was ready to buy one. He then sold her minerals to cure her kidney ailment, a can of sage "to make her look like a girl again," and an application of plain mud to take her wrinkles away. Lee renewed his pressure on Mrs. Shaefer to buy his machine when she visited him the next day. After another treatment with the machine, he told her that "her entire body was shot through with tumors and cysts." He then sold her some capsules that he asserted would take care of the tumors and cysts until she could collect the money for buying his machine. When she submitted to his treatment with the capsules, Mrs. Shaefer felt intense pain. Leaving Lee's office, Mrs. Shaefer hurried over to her family physician, who treated her for burned tissue. For several days, she was ill as a result of Lee's treatment. Mrs. Shaefer never got around to joining the thousand or so people who paid Lee some $30,000 for his ozone machines. For Mrs. Shaefer, who had been given a clean bill of health by her own physician at the time she visited Lee, and her friend were agents for the California Pure Food and Drug Inspection Bureau. And she felt amply rewarded for her suffering when the evidence of Lee's quack shenanigans, gathered by the tape recorder under her friend's clothing, proved adequate in court for convicting Franklin D. Lee. The charge: violation of the California Medical Practices Act by practicing medicine without a license and selling misbranded drugs. The sentence: 360 days' confinement in the county jail.
A tsunami may be started by a sea bottom slide, an earthquake or a volcanic eruption. The most infamous of all was launched by the explosion of the island of Krakatoa in 1883; it raced across the Pacific at 300 miles an hour, devastated the coasts of Java and Sumatra with waves 100 to 130 feet high, and pounded the shore as far away as San Francisco. The ancient Greeks recorded several catastrophic inundations by huge waves. Whether or not Plato's tale of the lost continent of Atlantis is true, skeptics concede that the myth may have some foundation in a great tsunami of ancient times. Indeed, a tremendously destructive tsunami that arose in the Arabian Sea in 1945 has even revived the interest of geologists and archaeologists in the Biblical story of the Flood. One of the most damaging tsunami on record followed the famous Lisbon earthquake of November 1, 1755; its waves persisted for a week and were felt as far away as the English coast. Tsunami are rare, however, in the Atlantic Ocean; they are far more common in the Pacific. Japan has had 15 destructive ones (eight of them disastrous) since 1596. The Hawaiian Islands are struck severely an average of once every 25 years. In 1707 an earthquake in Japan generated waves so huge that they piled into the Inland Sea; one wave swamped more than 1,000 ships and boats in Osaka Bay. A tsunami in the Hawaiian Islands in 1869 washed away an entire town (Ponoluu), leaving only two forlorn trees standing where the community had been.
Bong! Bong! Startled him awake. The room vibrated as if a giant hand had rocked it. Bong! A dull boom and a throbbing echo. The walls bulged, the floor trembled, the windowpanes rattled. He stared at the far morning, expecting a pendulum to swing across the horizon. Bong! He raced to the window and yanked at the sash. Bong! The wood was old, the paint alligatored. Bong! A fresh breeze saluted him. Six o'clock! He put his head out. There was the slate roof of the church; ivy climbed the red brick walls like a green-scaled monster. The clock which had struck presented an innocent face. In the kitchen Mama was wiping the cupboards. "There's a tower and a steeple on the church a million feet high. And the loudest clock in the whole world!" "I know, Stephen," she smiled. "They say that our steeple is one hundred and sixty-two feet high. The clock you heard strike, it's really the town clock, was installed last April by Mrs. Shorter, on her birthday." He dressed, and sped outdoors. He crossed Broome Street to Orange Square. The steeple leaned backward, while the church advanced like a headless creature in a long, shapeless coat. The spire seemed to hold up the sky. Port Jervis, basking in the foothills, was the city of God. The Dutch Reformed Church, with two steeples and its own school was on Main Street; the Episcopal Church was one block down Sussex Street; the Catholic Saint Mary's Church, with an even taller steeple and a cross on top, stood on Ball Street. The Catholics had the largest cemetery, near the Neversink River where Main Street ran south; Stevie whistled when he passed these alien grounds. God was everywhere, in the belfry, in the steeple, in the clouds, in the trees, and in the mountains hulking on the horizon. Somewhere, beyond, where shadows lurked, must be the yawning pit of which Papa preached and the dreadful Lake of Fire. So, walking in awe, he became familiar with God, who resided chiefly in Drew Centennial Church with its high steeple and clock. There was no church like Drew Church, no preacher like Papa, who was intimate with Him, and could consign sinners to hellfire. To know God he must follow in Papa's footsteps. He was fortunate, and proud. The veterans, idling on their benches in the Square, beneath the soldiers' monument, got to their feet when Papa approached: "Morning, Reverend!" His being and His will, Stevie could not divide God from his Papa, illumined every parish face, turned the choir into a band of angels, and the pulpit into the tollgate to Heaven. "We have nine hundred and eleven members in our charge," Mama announced, "and three hundred and eighty Sunday-school scholars." When Papa went out to do God's work, Stevie often accompanied him in the buggy, which was drawn by Violet, the new black mare. Although they journeyed westerly as far as Germantown, beyond the Erie roundhouse and the machine shop, and along the Delaware and Hudson Canal, and northward to Brooklyn, below Point Peter, he could see the church spire wherever he looked back. Sometimes they went south and rolled past the tollhouse, "Afternoon, Reverend!," and crossed the suspension bridge to Matamoras; that was Pennsylvania. In the Delaware River, three long islands were overgrown with greening trees and underbrush. South of Laurel Grove Cemetery, and below the junction of the Neversink and the Delaware, was the Tri-State Rock, from which Stevie could spy New Jersey and Pennsylvania, as well as New York, simply by spinning around on his heel. On these excursions, Papa instructed him on man's chief end, which was his duty to God and his own salvation. However, a boy's lively eyes might rove.
They were west of the Sabine, but only God knew where. For three days, their stolid oxen had plodded up a blazing valley as flat and featureless as a dead sea. Molten glare singed their eyelids an angry crimson; suffocating air sapped their strength and strained their nerves to snapping; dust choked their throats and lay like acid in their lungs. And the valley stretched endlessly out ahead, scorched and baked and writhing in its heat, until it vanished into the throbbing wall of fiery orange brown haze. Ben Prime extended his high-stepped stride until he could lay his goad across the noses of the oxen. "Hoa-whup!" He commanded from his raw throat, and felt the pain of movement in his cracked, black burned lips. He removed his hat to let the trapped sweat cut rivulets through the dust film upon his gaunt face. He spat. The dust-thick saliva came from his mouth like balled cotton. He moved back to the wheel and stood there blowing, grasping the top of a spoke to still the trembling of his played-out limbs. The burning air dried his sweat-soaked clothes in salt-edged patches. He cleared his throat and wet his lips. As cheerfully as possible, he said, "Well, I guess we could all do with a little drink." He unlashed the dipper and drew water from a barrel. They could no longer afford the luxury of the canvas sweat bag that cooled it by evaporation. The water was warm and stale and had a brackish taste. But it was water. Thank the Lord, they still had water! He cleansed his mouth with a small quantity. He took a long but carefully controlled draught. He replenished the dipper and handed it to his young wife riding the hurricane deck. She took it grudgingly, her dark eyes baleful as they met his. She drank and pushed back her gingham bonnet to wet a kerchief and wipe her face. She set the dipper on the edge of the deck, leaving it for him to stretch after it while she looked on scornfully. "What happens when there's no more water?" She asked smolderingly. She was like charcoal, he thought, dark, opaque, explosive. Her thick hair was the color and texture of charcoal. Her temper sparked like charcoal when it first lights up. And all the time, she had the heat of hatred in her, like charcoal that is burning on its under side, but not visibly. A ripple ran through the muscles of his jaws, but he kept control upon his voice. "There must be some water under there." He tilted his homely face toward the dry bed of the river. "We can get it if we dig," he said patiently. "And add fever to our troubles?" She scoffed. "Or do you want to see if I can stand fever, too?" "We can boil it," he said. Her chin sharpened. "We're lost and burning up already," she bit out tensely. "The tires are rattling on the wheels now. They'll roll off in another day. There was no valley like this on your map. You don't even know where we're headed." "Hettie," he said as gently as he could, "we're still headed west. Somewhere, we'll hit a trail." "Somewhere!" She repeated. "Maybe in time to make a cross and dig our graves." His wide mouth compressed. In a way, he couldn't blame her. He had picked out this pathless trail, instead of the common one, in a moment of romantic fancy, to give them privacy on their honeymoon. It had been a mistake, but anything would have been a mistake, as it turned out. It wasn't the roughness and crudity and discomfort of the trip that had frightened her. She had hated the whole idea before they started.
Buffeted by swirling winds, the little green biplane struggled northward between the mountains beyond Northfield Gulf. Wires whined as a cold November blast rocked the silver wings, but the engine roar was reassuring to the pilot bundled in the open cockpit. He peered ahead and grinned as the railroad tracks came into view again below. "Good old iron compass!" He thought. A plume of smoke rose from a Central Vermont locomotive which idled behind a string of gravel cars, and little figures that were workmen labored to set the ruptured roadbed to rights. The girders of a shattered Dog River bridge lay strewn for half a mile downstream. Vermont's main railroad line was prostrate. And in the dark days after the Great Flood of 1927, the worst natural disaster in the state's history, the little plane was its sole replacement in carrying the United States mails. Rain of near cloudburst proportions had fallen for three full days and it was still raining on the morning of Friday, November 4, 1927, when officials of the Post Office Department's Railway Mail Service realized that their distribution system for Vermont had been almost totally destroyed overnight. Clerks and postmasters shoveled muck out of their offices, those who still had offices, and wondered how to move the mail. The state's railroad system counted miles of broken bridges and missing rights-of-way: it would obviously remain out of commission for weeks. And once medicine, food, clothing and shelter had been provided for the flood's victims, communications and the mail were the next top problems. From Burlington, outgoing mail could be ferried across Lake Champlain to the railroad at Port Kent, N.Y. But what came in was piling up. The nearest undisrupted end of track from Boston was at Concord, N.H. When Governor Al Smith offered New York National Guard planes to fly the mail in and out of the state, it seemed a likely temporary solution, easing Burlington's bottleneck and that at Montpelier too. The question was "Where to land?" There was no such thing as an airport in Vermont. Burlington aviator John J. Burns suggested the parade ground southwest of Fort Ethan Allen, and soon a dozen hastily-summoned National Guard pilots were bringing their wide-winged "Jenny" and DeHaviland two-seaters to rest on the frozen sod of the military base. The only available field that could be used near flood-ravaged Montpelier was on the Towne farm off upper Main Street, a narrow hillside where takeoffs and landings could be safely made only under light wind conditions. Over in Barre the streets had been deep in swirling water, and bridges were crumpled and gone. Anticipating delivery of medicines and yeast by plane, Granite City citizens formed an airfield committee and with the aid of quarrymen and the 172nd Infantry, Vermont National Guard, laid out runways on Wilson flat, high on Millstone Hill. The "Barre Aviation Field" was set to receive its first aircraft the Sunday following the flood. Though the makeshift airports were ready, the York State Guard flyers proved unable to keep any kind of mail schedule. They had courage but their meager training consisted of weekend hops in good weather, in and out of established airports, and the increasingly cold weather soon raised hob with the water cooled engines of their World War I planes. It seemed like a good time for officials to use a recently-passed law empowering the post office department to contract for the transport of first class mail by air. They had to act fast, for letters were clogging the terminals. Down in Concord, New Hampshire, was a flier in the right place at the right time: Robert S. Fogg, a native New Englander, had been a World War I flying instructor, barnstormer, and one of the original planners of the Concord Airport.
I don't really believe in intuition. But I swear to you from the moment I opened my eyes, I knew it was going to be a bad day. Part of it was the weather, so foggy it would take me twice as long to get to the hospital. Part of it was being so tired, I'd not only had my usual full day yesterday, but a dinner meeting as well, that kept me up late. But the rest of it, the main part, wasn't based on logic at all. It was just going to be one of those days. For the thousandth time, I wished I'd chosen some nice, nine-to-five, five-days-a-week profession. And for the thousandth time, I answered myself. I hadn't chosen medicine, it had chosen me. Actually, I shouldn't complain, I told myself in the shaving mirror. I had a lot to be thankful for. A profession that brought me as good an income as mine wasn't to be sneezed at. Maybe I didn't see as much of Gladdy as I'd like, but how much worse it would have been if I'd had to board her out somewhere after Alice went, send my daughter to an orphanage or a boarding-home. At least, we were together and we had Mrs. Hodges, bless her, to look after us, no mother could be fonder of Gladdy than Mrs. Hodges was. I was lucky in lots of ways, no doubt about it. Especially in the way Gladdy had turned out. Growing up without a mother from the time she was three, it wasn't a good thing for a child, even knowing the kind of mother Alice had been. But I mustn't start on Alice. She is a closed book, a picture I keep on my bureau, but never look at. If she'd kept on as she'd been going, the story I'd told Gladdy would probably have been true by now, anyhow... As usual, Gladdy's bright smile greeted me at the breakfast table. Her first class wasn't until ten, but she always got up to have breakfast with me. It made me feel good and knowing that she'd decided, all on her own, to go to college right here in town made me feel good, too. Oh, I knew that I couldn't give myself all the credit for her decision. I had a feeling that young Pete Michelson, the most promising intern at Fairview, had something to do with it, too. She'd been out with Pete the night before and her gay chatter about their date lightened my mood a little. But once I was alone again, driving to the hospital, the heaviness returned. If she and Pete were really getting serious, I'd have to do some hard thinking. Should I tell him the truth about Alice? Did he have a right to know the secret I'd kept from Gladdy all these years?
Sulphur, oil, and copra make the kind of tinder any firebug dreams of. I suppose a Lascar sailor had sneaked a cigarette in the hold and touched off the blaze. Now, roaring up in great oily clouds of smoke and flames, the fierce heat quickly drove us to the stern where we huddled like suffocating sheep, not knowing what to do... The lifeboats were stuck fast. We couldn't budge them. I heard a cry from a stoker as a pillar of flame leaped from a hatch and tongued the man's bare back. He sprinted to the rail and leaped overboard into the shark-infested waters. One especially bad detonation shook Lifeboat No. 3 which trembled violently in the davits. Brassnose yelled: "Come on, Sommers, Max... step on it, we got a chance now. Heave on those ropes; the boat's come unstuck." We pulled and swore and yanked and wept, scraping our hands until they bled profusely. The Bonaventure was quivering and lurching like an old spavined mare. Her stern was down and a sharp list helped us to cut loose the lifeboat which dropped heavily into the water. Brassnose, Max and I leaped into the sea and swam to the boat. "Let's get away fast," said Brassnose, shaking water from his mop of bleached hair. "That tub is going to explode all at once." Then the Bonaventure seemed to disintegrate with a roar of live steam, geysers of sparks and flames, and a dense cloud of black-and-orange smoke. Dimly, we heard the voices of men in mortal agony but we couldn't go back into that inferno. Already our leaky lifeboat was filled with five inches of water. "Sommers, you bale while we row," Brassnose commanded. As best as I could determine, we were some 700 miles west of New Guinea, in the Bismark Archipelago. Three days previously, we had steamed past barren Rennell Island in the distance. Now we peered anxiously for any speck of land in the Pacific, for this interminable bailing would have to stop soon. There were gigantic blisters and rope burns on our hands; our muscles were hot wires of pain. Brassnose was strangely silent. The big man with the whitened hair murmured something: his words sounded as if they were in the Manu tongue, which I recognized, having studied the dialect in my Anthropology 6, class at the University of Chicago. He then said something which struck a chord in my memory. "God help us if we're near the island of Eromonga. We'd be in real trouble then. I'd rather keep bailing, or sink." I was puzzled by the remark, then I recalled the voice of mild Professor Howard Griggs three years ago in a university lecture on primitive societies. He had been speaking of this archipelago: "Even when the islands were under German mandate before World War I, Europeans gave Eromonga a wide berth. The place is inhabited by several hundred warlike women who are anachronisms of the Twentieth Century, stone age amazons who live in an all-female, matriarchal society which is self-sufficient." I remembered, too, the jesting voice of a classmate, Bobby Pauson: "But how do they reproduce, Dr. Griggs? I'm sure that males have something to do with that process!" There had been classroom guffaws which quickly subsided as Professor Griggs said dryly: "I see your point, Pauson. Of course, males play a role there, but believe me when I say you wouldn't enjoy yourself one bit on Eromonga. Indeed, you wouldn't live long, for the females either drive the men they've seized from neighboring islands back to their boats after exploiting them for amatory purposes, or they destroy them by revolting but ingenious methods. In fact, one important aspect of their very religion is the annihilation of men." "I think I know what you mean, Brassnose," I said. "I know something about Eromonga. Let's hope we come to a safer place." But we didn't. Three hours later, while we were bailing desperately, a dot of land came into view.
The first rattle of the machine guns, at 7:10 in the evening, roused around me the varied voices and faces of fear. "Sounds exactly like last time." The young man spoke steadily enough, but all at once he looked grotesquely unshaven. The middle-aged man said over and over, "Why did I come here, why did I come here." Then he was sick. Amid the crackle of small arms and automatic weapons, I heard the thumping of mortars. Then the lights went out. This was my second day in Vientiane, the administrative capital of Laos, and my thoughts were none too brave. Where was my flashlight? Where should I go? To my room? Better stay in the hotel lobby, where the walls looked good and thick. Chinese and Indian merchants across the street were slamming their steel shutters. Hotel attendants pulled parked bicycles into the lobby. A woman with a small boy slipped in between them. "Please," she said, "please." She held out her hand to show that she had money. The American newspaperman worried about getting to the cable office. But what was the story? Had the Communist-led Pathet Lao finally come this far? Or was it another revolt inside Vientiane? "Let's play hero," I said. "Let's go to the roof and see." By 7:50 the answer was plain. There had been an eclipse of the moon. A traditional Lao explanation is that the moon was being swallowed by a toad, and the remedy was to make all possible noise, ideally with firearms. The din was successful, too, for just before the moon disappeared, the frightened toad had begun to spit it out again, which meant good luck all around. How quaint it all seemed the next day. A restaurant posted a reminder to patrons "who became excited and left without paying their checks." But everyone I met had sought cover first and asked questions later. And no wonder, for Vientiane, the old City of Sandalwood, had become the City of Bullet Holes. I saw holes in planes at the airport and in cars in the streets. Along the main thoroughfares hardly a house had not been peppered. In place of the police headquarters was a new square filled with rubble. Mortars had demolished the defense ministry and set fire to the American Embassy next door. What had been the ambassador's suite was now jagged walls of blackened brick. This damage had been done in the battle of Vientiane, fought less than three months earlier when four successive governments had ruled here in three days (December 9-11, 1960). And now, in March, all Laos suffered a state of siege. The Pathet Lao forces held two northern provinces and openly took the offensive in three more. Throughout the land their hit-and-run terrorists spread fear of ambush and death.
On April 17, 1610, the sturdy little three-masted bark, Discovery, weighed anchor in St. Katherine's Pool, London, and floated down the Thames toward the sea. She carried, besides her captain, a crew of twenty-one and provisions for a voyage of exploration of the Arctic waters of North America. Seventeen months later, on September 6, 1611, an Irish fishing boat sighted the Discovery limping eastward outside Galway Bay. When she reached port, she was found to have on board only eight men, all near starvation. The captain was gone, and the mate was gone. The man who now commanded her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman. What disaster struck the Discovery during those seventeen months? What happened to the fourteen missing men? These questions have remained one of the great sea mysteries of all time. For hundreds of years, the evidence available consisted of (1) the captain's fragmentary journal, (2) a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivors, (3) a note found in a dead man's desk on board, and (4) several second-hand reports. All told, they offered a highly confused picture. But since 1927, researchers digging into ancient court records and legal files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information. Not enough to do away with all doubts, but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the events of the voyage. Historians have had two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations. First, they wanted to clarify a tantalizing, bizarre enigma. Second, they believed it important to determine the fate of the captain, a man whose name is permanently stamped on our maps, on American towns and counties, on a great American river, and on half a million square miles of Arctic seas. The name: Henry Hudson. This is the story of his last tragic voyage, as nearly as we are able, or ever, probably, will be able, to determine: The sailing in the spring of 1610 was Hudson's fourth in four years. Each time his objective had been the same, a direct water passage from Western Europe to the Far East. In 1607 and 1608, the English Muscovy Company had sent him northward to look for a route over the North Pole or across the top of Russia. Twice he had failed, and the Muscovy Company indicated it would not back him again. In 1609, the Dutch East India Company hired Hudson, gave him two learned geographers, fitted him out with a ship called the Half Moon, and supplied him with Dutch sailors. This time he turned westward, to the middle Atlantic coast of North America. His chief discovery was important, the Great North (later, the Hudson) River, but it produced no northwest passage. When the Half Moon put in at Dartmouth, England, in the fall of 1609, word of Hudson's findings leaked out, and English interest in him revived. The government forbade Hudson to return to Amsterdam with his ship. He thereupon went to London and spent the winter talking to men of wealth. By springtime, he was supported by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage of Henry, Prince of Wales. He had obtained and provisioned a veteran ship called the Discovery and had recruited a crew of twenty-one, the largest he had ever commanded. The purpose of this fourth voyage was clear. A century of exploration had established that a great land mass, North and South America, lay between Europe and the Indies. One by one, the openings in the coast that promised a passage through had been explored and discarded. In fact, Hudson's sail up the Great North River had disposed of one of the last hopes. But there remained one mysterious, unexplored gap, far to the north. Nearly twenty-five years before, Captain John Davis had noted, as he sailed near the Arctic Circle, "a very great gulf, the water whirling and roaring, as it were the meeting of tides." He named this opening, between Baffin Island and Labrador, the "Furious Overfall." (Later, it was to be called Hudson Strait.) In 1602, George Waymouth, in the same little Discovery that Hudson now commanded, had sailed 300 miles up the strait before his frightened men turned the ship back. Hudson now proposed to sail all the way through and test the seas beyond for the long-sought waterway. Even Hudson, experienced in Arctic sailing and determined as he was, must have had qualms as he slid down the Thames. Ahead were perilous, ice-filled waters. On previous voyages, it had been in precisely such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain.
